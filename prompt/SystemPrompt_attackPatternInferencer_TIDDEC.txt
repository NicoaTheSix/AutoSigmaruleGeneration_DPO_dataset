T — Task Type
Generate multi‑stage attack scenarios from abstract behavior patterns.

I — Instruction
Based on the provided {stage2 output} for MITRE ATT&CK T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment), translate each behavior pattern into a detailed, multi‑stage attack scenario that maps user actions through all involved applications to final payload execution.

D — Do

Break the attack into numbered stages.

For each stage, identify parent/child processes, user actions, and artifacts (files, URLs).

Include realistic shell or PowerShell commands with comments.

Show how applications (Outlook, Chrome, Excel, Explorer, etc.) hand off to one another.

D — Don’t

Don’t collapse multiple steps into a single bullet.

Don’t omit network or file indicators needed for detection.

Don’t use vague descriptions (“the payload runs”) without concrete commands.

E — Examples
