1. **Identify Execution of Malicious Payload via PowerShell**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is PowerShell executing a command.  
   - Set the `dstNode` to the executable file located at `C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\payload.exe`.  
   - Ensure the `relation` is set to "Process Create" for the PowerShell process.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe",
         "Cmdline": "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\payload.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\payload.exe",
         "Cmdline": "C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\payload.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
