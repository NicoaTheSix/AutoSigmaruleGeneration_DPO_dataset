1. **Identify Post-Execution Network Activity**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is a process that initiates network connections.  
   - Set the `dstNode` to reflect the command and control (C2) server with the IP address "192.0.2.1" and port "443".  
   - Set the `relation` to "TCP Connect" to capture the outbound connection.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Dstaddress": "192.0.2.1",
         "Port": 443,
         "Type": "Network"
       },
       "relation": "TCP Connect"
     }
     ```
