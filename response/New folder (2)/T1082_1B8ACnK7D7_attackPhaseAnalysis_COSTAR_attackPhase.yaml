1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Information Gathering*  
   - Analyze system commands and tools used for information retrieval (e.g., `systeminfo`, `ver`, `uname`, `df`).  
   - Monitor API calls and scripts that query system details (e.g., WMI queries, `GetSystemInfo`, `esxcli` commands).  
   - Identify network device CLI commands that provide system information (e.g., `show version`).  

   Phase 2: *Data Exfiltration*  
   - Track communication patterns to command and control (C2) servers that include system information (e.g., beaconing with OS version, hostname).  
   - Monitor for file creation or modification in temporary directories that may contain system information (e.g., `%temp%\\download`).  
   - Analyze network traffic for API calls to cloud services that may expose system details (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure APIs).  

   Phase 3: *Follow-on Actions*  
   - Investigate subsequent actions taken based on gathered system information (e.g., payload delivery, lateral movement).  
   - Identify changes in system state or configuration that may indicate exploitation based on the information collected.  
   - Monitor for indicators of further compromise or persistence mechanisms that leverage the initial system information.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: OS Version Identification  
     - Examples: "4H RAT sends an OS version identifier in its beacons."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: System Information Collection  
     - Examples: "ADVSTORESHELL can run Systeminfo to gather information about the victim."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Command Execution for Discovery  
     - Examples: "admin@338 actors used the following commands after exploiting a machine with LOWBALL malware to obtain information about the OS: ver >> %temp%\\download."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Data Transmission to C2  
     - Examples: "Felismus collects the system information, including hostname and OS version, and sends it to the C2 server."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Temporary Files for Data Storage  
     - Examples: "During Operation Honeybee, the threat actors collected the computer name, OS, and other system information using cmd /c systeminfo > %temp%\\ temp.ini."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Follow-on Exploitation  
     - Examples: "APT38 has attempted to get detailed information about a compromised host, including the operating system, version, patches, hotfixes, and service packs."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: System Configuration Enumeration  
     - Examples: "TrickBot gathers the OS version, machine name, CPU type, amount of RAM available, and UEFI/BIOS firmware information from the victimâ€™s machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: API Calls for System Information  
     - Examples: "Koadic can obtain the OS version and build, computer name, and processor architecture from a compromised host."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: System Information for Payload Development  
     - Examples: "System Information Discovery combined with information gathered from other forms of discovery and reconnaissance can drive payload development and concealment."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082
