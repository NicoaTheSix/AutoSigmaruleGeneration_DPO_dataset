Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a backdoor on the victim's machine.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Update" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for unusual email subjects and attachments with common file names (e.g., "Invoice", "Report").

```shell
# Log the email received with attachment
Get-MessageTrace -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) -EndDate (Get-Date) | Where-Object { $_.Subject -like "*Important Update*" }
```

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel, triggering the execution of a macro embedded in the document.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file "Invoice_2023.xlsx", macro code execution.
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for the execution of macros in Excel files, especially those that download additional payloads.

```shell
# Monitor for macro execution in Excel
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Excel/Operational" | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 1000 -and $_.Message -like "*macro*" }
```

**Stage 3: Payload Download and Execution**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Internet Explorer/Edge
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command that downloads a malicious executable from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command, URL of the malicious executable (e.g., "http://malicious-site.com/payload.exe").
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for PowerShell commands that download executables, especially those originating from Excel macros.

```shell
# Log PowerShell commands that download files
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows PowerShell" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" -or $_.Message -like "*DownloadFile*" }
```

**Stage 4: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Explorer, Task Scheduler
- **User Action**: The downloaded executable installs a backdoor and creates a scheduled task for persistence.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entry, backdoor executable (e.g., "C:\ProgramData\malicious.exe").
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for new scheduled tasks created by unknown executables.

```shell
# Check for new scheduled tasks created by unknown executables
Get-ScheduledTask | Where-Object { $_.Actions -like "*malicious.exe*" }
```

**Stage 5: Command and Control Communication**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Networking Stack
- **User Action**: The backdoor communicates with the attacker's command and control server to receive further instructions.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to the C2 server (e.g., "http://malicious-site.com").
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor outbound connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains.

```shell
# Monitor network connections to known malicious domains
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.RemoteAddress -like "*malicious-site.com*" }
```
