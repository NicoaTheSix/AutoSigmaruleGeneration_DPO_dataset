1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Discovery*  
   - Identify services running on local and remote hosts  
   - Utilize network scanning tools to enumerate open ports  
   - Perform OS fingerprinting to assess potential vulnerabilities  

   Phase 2: *Exploitation Preparation*  
   - Analyze discovered services for known vulnerabilities  
   - Map network infrastructure to identify critical assets  
   - Conduct reconnaissance on cloud and on-premises environments  

   Phase 3: *Execution*  
   - Execute targeted attacks based on identified vulnerabilities  
   - Utilize discovered services to establish persistence or lateral movement  
   - Deploy malware or exploit tools to compromise identified services  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Network Scanning  
     - Examples: "Agrius used the open-source port scanner WinEggDrop to perform detailed scans of hosts of interest in victim networks."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Service Enumeration  
     - Examples: "BlackByte has used tools such as NetScan to enumerate network services in victim environments."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Vulnerability Assessment  
     - Examples: "BackdoorDiplomacy has used SMBTouch, a vulnerability scanner, to determine whether a target is vulnerable to EternalBlue malware."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: OS Fingerprinting  
     - Examples: "APT32 performed network scanning on the network to search for open ports, services, OS fingerprinting, and other vulnerabilities."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Cloud Service Discovery  
     - Examples: "TeamTNT has also used malware that utilizes zmap and zgrab to search for vulnerable services in cloud environments."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Port Scanning  
     - Examples: "Cobalt Group leveraged an open-source tool called SoftPerfect Network Scanner to perform network scanning."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Targeted Reconnaissance  
     - Examples: "Lazarus Group has used nmap from a router VM to scan ports on systems within the restricted segment of an enterprise network."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Active Directory Queries  
     - Examples: "BlackByte Ransomware identifies remote systems via active directory queries for hostnames prior to launching remote ransomware payloads."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046
