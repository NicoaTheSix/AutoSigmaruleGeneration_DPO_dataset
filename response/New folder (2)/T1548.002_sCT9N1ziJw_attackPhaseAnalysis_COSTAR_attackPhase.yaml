1. **Framework Section**  
   **Phase 1: UAC Bypass Techniques**  
   - Identify and analyze methods used to bypass UAC, such as DLL hijacking, COM object manipulation, and registry modifications.  
   - Monitor for execution of known UAC bypass executables (e.g., `eventvwr.exe`, `fodhelper.exe`, `ieinstal.exe`).  
   - Review system logs for anomalies related to privilege escalation attempts and UAC prompt suppression.  

   **Phase 2: Privilege Escalation Execution**  
   - Detect the execution of processes that have been elevated without user consent, focusing on integrity levels and process parent-child relationships.  
   - Analyze command-line arguments for known UAC bypass techniques and suspicious payloads.  
   - Investigate the creation or modification of scheduled tasks or services that may facilitate privilege escalation.  

   **Phase 3: Post-Exploitation Activities**  
   - Monitor for the installation of backdoors or persistence mechanisms following privilege escalation.  
   - Track changes to system configurations or security settings that may indicate an attempt to maintain elevated access.  
   - Review for unusual network activity or connections initiated by processes that have gained elevated privileges.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: UAC Bypass via COM Interface  
     - Examples: "Avaddon bypasses UAC using the CMSTPLUA COM interface."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Registry Key Manipulation for UAC Bypass  
     - Examples: "BitPaymer can suppress UAC prompts by setting the HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command registry key."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Execution of Elevated Processes  
     - Examples: "Cobalt Strike can use a number of known techniques to bypass Windows UAC."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Scheduled Task Abuse for Privilege Escalation  
     - Examples: "CHIMNEYSWEEP can make use of the Windows SilentCleanup scheduled task to execute its payload with elevated privileges."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Post-Exploitation Backdoor Installation  
     - Examples: "Bumblebee has the ability to bypass UAC to deploy post exploitation tools with elevated privileges."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Legitimate Tools for Malicious Purposes  
     - Examples: "Raspberry Robin will use the legitimate Windows utility fodhelper.exe to run processes at elevated privileges without requiring a User Account Control prompt."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: DLL Hijacking for UAC Bypass  
     - Examples: "H1N1 bypasses user access control by using a DLL hijacking vulnerability in the Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe)."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002
