1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Data Discovery*  
   - Identify and enumerate local files of interest (e.g., documents, databases)  
   - Utilize command-line tools (e.g., `cmd`, `PowerShell`, `forfiles`) to search for specific file types  
   - Access and analyze configuration files and local databases for sensitive information  

   Phase 2: *Data Collection*  
   - Execute scripts or commands to gather files from the local system  
   - Use automated collection tools to extract data from compromised hosts  
   - Stage collected files in a temporary location for potential exfiltration  

   Phase 3: *Data Exfiltration*  
   - Transfer collected files to external command and control (C2) servers  
   - Utilize various protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) for file upload  
   - Implement obfuscation techniques to hide exfiltration activities  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Local File Enumeration  
     - Examples: "Fox Kitten has searched local system resources to access sensitive documents."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Automated Data Collection  
     - Examples: "Action RAT can collect local data from an infected machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Upload to C2  
     - Examples: "Lazarus Group has collected data and files from compromised networks."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Type Specific Collection  
     - Examples: "GravityRAT steals files with the following extensions: .docx, .doc, .pptx, .ppt, .xlsx, .xls, .rtf, and .pdf."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Command-Line Tools for Data Gathering  
     - Examples: "Forfiles can be used to act on files/directories in a system."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Obfuscation During Exfiltration  
     - Examples: "During Operation MidnightEclipse, threat actors stole saved cookies and login data from targeted systems."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005
