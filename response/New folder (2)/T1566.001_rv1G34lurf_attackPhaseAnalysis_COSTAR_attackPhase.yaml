1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Delivery*  
   - Analyze email headers for spoofing indicators (e.g., "From" address discrepancies).  
   - Monitor for common spearphishing keywords and phrases in email body content.  
   - Identify and categorize attachment types (e.g., .docx, .xls, .zip) in incoming emails.  

   Phase 2: *Execution*  
   - Detect execution of processes initiated by opening attachments (e.g., Microsoft Office applications).  
   - Monitor for command-line arguments that indicate exploitation attempts (e.g., macros, scripts).  
   - Analyze file behavior upon execution, including file modifications and network connections.  

   Phase 3: *Post-Execution*  
   - Track persistence mechanisms employed by malware (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks).  
   - Monitor for unusual outbound network traffic patterns indicative of data exfiltration.  
   - Analyze system logs for signs of lateral movement or privilege escalation following initial compromise.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Malicious Attachment Delivery  
     - Examples: "Sandworm Team obtained their initial foothold using Microsoft Office attachments delivered through phishing emails."  
     - Associated Phase: Delivery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1566.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Exploitation via Document Macros  
     - Examples: "FIN4 has used spearphishing emails containing attachments with embedded malicious macros."  
     - Associated Phase: Execution  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1566.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Password-Protected Archives  
     - Examples: "APT1 has sent spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments with password-protected RAR files."  
     - Associated Phase: Delivery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1566.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Execution of Malicious Payloads  
     - Examples: "Bumblebee has gained execution through luring users into opening malicious attachments."  
     - Associated Phase: Execution  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1566.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Lateral Movement Post-Compromise  
     - Examples: "MuddyWater has compromised third parties and used compromised accounts to send spearphishing emails with targeted attachments."  
     - Associated Phase: Post-Execution  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1566.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Social Engineering Techniques  
     - Examples: "The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened."  
     - Associated Phase: Delivery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1566.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Manipulation of File Extensions  
     - Examples: "Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons to make attached executables appear to be document files."  
     - Associated Phase: Delivery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1566.001
