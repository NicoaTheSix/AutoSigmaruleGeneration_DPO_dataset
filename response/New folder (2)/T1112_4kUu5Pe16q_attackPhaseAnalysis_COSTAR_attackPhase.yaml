1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Registry Interaction*  
   - Monitor for modifications to critical registry keys (e.g., `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`, `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`) that may indicate malicious activity.  
   - Analyze command-line usage of `reg.exe` and other tools that interact with the Windows Registry for suspicious patterns.  
   - Detect changes to registry values that could indicate defense evasion tactics, such as disabling security features or enabling macros.  

   Phase 2: *Persistence Mechanisms*  
   - Identify the creation or modification of registry keys associated with persistence (e.g., `Run`, `RunOnce`, `Services`).  
   - Track registry changes that involve obfuscation techniques, such as null character prepending or random naming conventions.  
   - Monitor for registry modifications that enable remote access or lateral movement capabilities, such as enabling the Remote Registry service.  

   Phase 3: *Execution and Defense Evasion*  
   - Detect registry modifications that facilitate the execution of malicious payloads (e.g., altering `ServiceDLL` values).  
   - Analyze changes to registry keys that may impair system defenses (e.g., disabling UAC, modifying firewall settings).  
   - Monitor for registry entries that store malicious configurations or payloads, particularly those that may be hidden or obfuscated.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Registry Modification for Execution  
     - Examples: Sandworm Team modified in-registry Internet settings to lower internet security before launching `rundll32.exe`.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1112  

   - **Pattern Name**: Persistence via Registry Keys  
     - Examples: Agent Tesla achieves persistence by modifying Registry key entries.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1112  

   - **Pattern Name**: Defense Evasion through Registry Changes  
     - Examples: Gamaredon Group removed security settings for VBA macro execution by changing registry values.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1112  

   - **Pattern Name**: Obfuscation Techniques in Registry  
     - Examples: Adversaries may prepend key names with a null character to hide them from standard queries.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1112  

   - **Pattern Name**: Remote Access Configuration  
     - Examples: APT41 used a malware variant to modify the registry in order to steal credentials.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1112  

   - **Pattern Name**: Disabling Security Features  
     - Examples: LockBit 3.0 changes the Registry values for Group Policy refresh time to disable SmartScreen.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1112  

   - **Pattern Name**: Credential Storage Manipulation  
     - Examples: Wizard Spider modified the WDigest registry key to allow plaintext credentials to be cached in memory.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1112
