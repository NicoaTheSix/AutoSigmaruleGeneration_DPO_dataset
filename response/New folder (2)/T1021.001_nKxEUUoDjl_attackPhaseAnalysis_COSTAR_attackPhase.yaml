1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Initial Access*  
   - Focus on identifying the use of valid accounts for RDP access.  
   - Monitor for credential access techniques that may lead to RDP logins.  
   - Analyze logs for unusual RDP connection attempts, especially from external IPs.  

   Phase 2: *Execution*  
   - Detect RDP session initiation and any associated command-line activities.  
   - Monitor for the use of tools that facilitate RDP connections (e.g., Plink, rdpwinst).  
   - Analyze network traffic for RDP protocol usage and tunneling behaviors.  

   Phase 3: *Lateral Movement*  
   - Identify patterns of RDP usage across multiple systems within the network.  
   - Monitor for concurrent RDP sessions and any unusual session activity.  
   - Analyze file access and transfer activities during RDP sessions for signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: RDP Access via Compromised Accounts  
     - Examples: "Agrius tunnels RDP traffic through deployed web shells to access victim environments via compromised accounts."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP Tunneling for Remote Access  
     - Examples: "Agrius used the Plink tool to tunnel RDP connections for remote access and lateral movement in victim environments."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Lateral Movement via RDP  
     - Examples: "Akira has used RDP for lateral movement."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP for Persistence  
     - Examples: "APT3 enables the Remote Desktop Protocol for persistence."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP Session Management  
     - Examples: "APT39 has been seen using RDP for lateral movement and persistence, in some cases employing the rdpwinst tool for management of multiple sessions."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP Credential Harvesting  
     - Examples: "Leviathan has targeted RDP credentials and used it to move through the victim environment."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Interactive RDP Sessions for Data Exfiltration  
     - Examples: "Blue Mockingbird has used Remote Desktop to log on to servers interactively and manually copy files to remote hosts."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP Port Exposure  
     - Examples: "During C0018, the threat actors opened a variety of ports to establish RDP connections, including ports 28035, 32467, 41578, and 46892."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001
