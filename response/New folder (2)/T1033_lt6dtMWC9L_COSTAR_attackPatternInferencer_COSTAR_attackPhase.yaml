Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario involves an attacker sending a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in a commonly used office application. The user opens the attachment, which triggers a series of events leading to the execution of a payload that establishes a foothold in the victim's environment. The attack leverages multiple applications, including email clients, web browsers, and office suites, to achieve its objectives.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Email**
- **Application Involved**: Outlook (or any email client)
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line that appears legitimate (e.g., "Invoice Attached"). The user opens the email and downloads the attached file (e.g., `Invoice.docx`).
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (`Invoice.docx`), and user interaction logs.

```shell
# Log the email access and attachment download
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -InstanceId 4624 | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoice.docx*" }
```

**Stage 2: Exploitation of the Document**
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word
- **User Action**: The user opens the `Invoice.docx` file, which contains a macro designed to execute a PowerShell command.
- **Key Artifacts**: Macro code within the document, process creation logs for `WINWORD.EXE`.

```shell
# Monitor for macro execution in Word documents
Get-WinEvent -LogName Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*WINWORD.EXE*" }
```

**Stage 3: Payload Execution**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command that downloads a malicious payload from a remote server (e.g., `http://malicious.com/payload.exe`).
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command logs, network traffic to the malicious URL, and downloaded file (`payload.exe`).

```shell
# Capture PowerShell command execution
Get-WinEvent -LogName Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" }
```

**Stage 4: Establishing Persistence**
- **Application Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload (`payload.exe`) sets up a scheduled task to ensure it runs on system startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task logs, process creation logs for `schtasks.exe`.

```shell
# Monitor for scheduled task creation
Get-WinEvent -LogName Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Create*" }
```

**Stage 5: Command and Control Communication**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell or custom executable
- **User Action**: The payload initiates a connection to the attacker's command and control (C2) server to receive further instructions.
- **Key Artifacts**: Outbound network connections to the C2 server, logs of the executable's network activity.

```shell
# Capture outbound connections to known malicious IPs
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.RemoteAddress -eq "malicious.com" }
```

**Stage 6: Data Exfiltration**
- **Application Involved**: Various applications (e.g., PowerShell, FTP client)
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the established connection to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim's machine.
- **Key Artifacts**: Logs of data transfer activities, file access logs for sensitive files.

```shell
# Monitor for large outbound data transfers
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.State -eq "Established" -and $_.RemotePort -eq 21 }
```
