1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Initial Access and Tool Transfer*  
   - Monitor for command and control (C2) communications that may indicate file transfers (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SFTP).  
   - Analyze network traffic for unusual file download patterns or connections to known malicious domains.  
   - Inspect logs for the use of common file transfer utilities (e.g., `curl`, `wget`, `certutil`, `PowerShell` commands).  

   Phase 2: *Execution and Payload Delivery*  
   - Detect execution of downloaded files, particularly those initiated by common scripting languages (e.g., PowerShell, Bash).  
   - Monitor for the creation of new processes that may indicate the execution of downloaded payloads.  
   - Analyze file integrity checks (e.g., hash verification) that may indicate an adversary is verifying the integrity of downloaded files.  

   Phase 3: *Lateral Movement and Internal Tool Transfer*  
   - Track file transfers between internal systems, especially those initiated by administrative tools or scripts.  
   - Monitor for the use of remote execution tools (e.g., PsExec, WinRM) that may indicate lateral movement.  
   - Analyze logs for unusual file access patterns or the use of file synchronization services (e.g., Dropbox, OneDrive) that may indicate data exfiltration or tool transfer.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: C2 File Download  
     - Examples: "ABK has the ability to download files from C2."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: PowerShell File Execution  
     - Examples: "APT41 downloaded post-exploitation tools such as Cobalt Strike via command shell following initial access."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Lateral Tool Transfer  
     - Examples: "During the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team pushed additional malicious tools onto an infected system to steal user credentials."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Integrity Verification  
     - Examples: "After downloading a file, a threat actor may attempt to verify its integrity by checking its hash value (e.g., via certutil -hashfile)."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of File Transfer Utilities  
     - Examples: "APT41 used certutil to download additional files."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Abuse of Cloud Services  
     - Examples: "Adversaries may leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Remote File Execution  
     - Examples: "Cobalt Strike can deliver additional payloads to victim machines."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Administrative Tools for File Transfer  
     - Examples: "During Night Dragon, threat actors used administrative utilities to deliver Trojan components to remote systems."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105
