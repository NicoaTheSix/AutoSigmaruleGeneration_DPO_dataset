1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Command and Control Establishment*  
   - Monitor for HTTP/S and WebSocket traffic patterns that deviate from normal behavior.  
   - Analyze HTTP headers and payloads for unusual or suspicious content, such as encoded data or unexpected parameters.  
   - Track connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains associated with C2 infrastructure.  

   Phase 2: *Data Exfiltration and Command Execution*  
   - Inspect outbound HTTP/S requests for signs of data exfiltration, such as large POST requests or unusual file types being sent.  
   - Identify command execution patterns within HTTP requests, particularly those that utilize GET or POST methods to send commands to the C2 server.  
   - Monitor for responses from C2 servers that may contain commands or payloads, especially those embedded in legitimate-looking traffic.  

   Phase 3: *Persistence Mechanisms*  
   - Investigate the use of HTTP/S for maintaining persistence, such as scheduled tasks or services that initiate connections to C2 servers.  
   - Analyze application logs for repeated connections to C2 servers, indicating potential backdoor activity.  
   - Review system configurations for any modifications that enable HTTP/S-based persistence, such as registry changes or new service installations.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: C2 Communication via HTTP POST  
     - Examples: "Sandworm Team used BlackEnergy to communicate via HTTP post requests."  
     - Associated Phase: Command and Control Establishment  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1071.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Data Exfiltration via HTTP POST  
     - Examples: "BlackByte collected victim device information then transmitted this via HTTP POST."  
     - Associated Phase: Data Exfiltration and Command Execution  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1071.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Command Execution via HTTP GET  
     - Examples: "ChChes communicates to its C2 server over HTTP and embeds data within the Cookie HTTP header."  
     - Associated Phase: Data Exfiltration and Command Execution  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1071.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of HTTP for Payload Delivery  
     - Examples: "APT41 used HTTP to download payloads for CVE-2019-19781."  
     - Associated Phase: Data Exfiltration and Command Execution  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1071.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: HTTP-based Persistence  
     - Examples: "Various implementations of CHOPSTICK communicate with C2 over HTTP."  
     - Associated Phase: Persistence Mechanisms  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1071.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: WebSocket for C2 Communication  
     - Examples: "Drovorub can use the WebSocket protocol and has initiated communication with C2 servers."  
     - Associated Phase: Command and Control Establishment  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1071.001
