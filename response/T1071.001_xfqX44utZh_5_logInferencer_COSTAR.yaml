1. **Identify Scheduled Task Creation for Persistence**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is a process that creates a scheduled task.  
   - Set the `dstNode` to reflect the scheduled task being created, which should include a command line that executes a suspicious executable.  
   - Ensure the `relation` is set to "Process Create" for the process that initiates the task creation.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe",
         "Cmdline": "schtasks.exe /create /tn \"MaliciousTask\" /tr \"C:\\Path\\To\\MaliciousPayload.exe\" /sc onlogon",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "MaliciousTask",
         "Type": "Registry" // Assuming the task is stored in the registry
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
