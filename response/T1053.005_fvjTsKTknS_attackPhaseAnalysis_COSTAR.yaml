1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Task Creation*  
   - Monitor the use of `schtasks.exe` and other methods to create scheduled tasks.  
   - Analyze command-line arguments for task creation, such as `/create`, `/tn`, `/tr`, `/sc`, and `/ru`.  
   - Identify the creation of tasks with unusual names or those that execute non-standard executables.  

   Phase 2: *Task Execution*  
   - Track the execution of scheduled tasks, focusing on their triggers and the context in which they run (e.g., SYSTEM, user).  
   - Monitor for the execution of tasks that run scripts or executables from unusual directories (e.g., `%APPDATA%`, `C:\Windows\Temp`).  
   - Analyze logs for task execution events, particularly those that occur at odd intervals or times.  

   Phase 3: *Task Obfuscation*  
   - Investigate modifications to task metadata, such as changes to the Security Descriptor (SD) registry value.  
   - Monitor for tasks that are hidden from standard queries (e.g., `schtasks /query`) and analyze registry keys associated with scheduled tasks.  
   - Identify patterns of task creation that involve obfuscation techniques, such as using legitimate task names or disguising malicious tasks as system tasks.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Scheduled Task Creation  
     - Examples: "APT3 downloader creates persistence by creating the following scheduled task: schtasks /create /tn 'mysc' /tr C:\\Users\\Public\\test.exe /sc ONLOGON /ru 'System'."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1053.005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Scheduled Task Execution  
     - Examples: "During the 2022 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team leveraged Scheduled Tasks through a Group Policy Object (GPO) to execute CaddyWiper at a predetermined time."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1053.005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Task Metadata Manipulation  
     - Examples: "An adversary may hide a task from schtasks /query and the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1053.005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Legitimate Task Names  
     - Examples: "Maze has created scheduled tasks using name variants such as 'Windows Update Security', 'Windows Update Security Patches', and 'Google Chrome Security Update', to launch Maze at a specific time."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1053.005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Remote Task Scheduling  
     - Examples: "During Operation CuckooBees, the threat actors used scheduled tasks to execute batch scripts for lateral movement."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1053.005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Persistence via Scheduled Tasks  
     - Examples: "AsyncRAT can create a scheduled task to maintain persistence on system start-up."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1053.005
