1. **Identify Execution of Malicious Payload via Windows Explorer**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is Windows Explorer (e.g., `explorer.exe`).  
   - Set the `dstNode` to the executable file located at `C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\payload.exe`.  
   - Ensure the `relation` is set to "Process Create" for the Windows Explorer process.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\payload.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
