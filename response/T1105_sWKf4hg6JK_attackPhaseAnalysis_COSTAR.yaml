1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Initial Access and Tool Acquisition*  
   - Monitor for command and control (C2) communications that may indicate file transfers (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SFTP).  
   - Analyze logs for the use of common file transfer utilities (e.g., `curl`, `wget`, `certutil`, `PowerShell` commands).  
   - Detect abnormal file downloads or uploads from external sources, especially from known malicious domains.  

   Phase 2: *Lateral Movement and Tool Distribution*  
   - Investigate internal network traffic for file transfer activities between compromised hosts (e.g., SMB, SCP).  
   - Monitor for the execution of scripts or commands that initiate file transfers or downloads on multiple systems.  
   - Identify the use of administrative tools (e.g., `PsExec`, `WinRM`) that may facilitate lateral movement and tool distribution.  

   Phase 3: *Post-Exploitation and Persistence*  
   - Track the installation of new tools or malware on compromised systems, including monitoring for changes in system files or registry keys.  
   - Analyze the integrity of downloaded files (e.g., hash checks) to ensure they are not tampered with.  
   - Monitor for the use of package managers or installers that may be abused to install additional tools (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `winget`).  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: C2 File Transfer  
     - Examples: "ABK has the ability to download files from C2."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Lateral Tool Transfer  
     - Examples: "During the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team pushed additional malicious tools onto an infected system."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Common Utilities  
     - Examples: "APT41 used certutil to download additional files."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Abuse of Package Managers  
     - Examples: "Adversaries may also abuse installers and package managers, such as yum or winget, to download tools to victim hosts."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Integrity Verification  
     - Examples: "After downloading a file, a threat actor may attempt to verify its integrity by checking its hash value (e.g., via certutil -hashfile)."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Remote File Syncing  
     - Examples: "Adversaries may leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Command Execution for Downloads  
     - Examples: "Agent Tesla can download additional files for execution on the victimâ€™s machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Web Services for File Transfer  
     - Examples: "Files can also be transferred using various Web Services as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1105
