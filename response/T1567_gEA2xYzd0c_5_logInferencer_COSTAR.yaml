1. **Identify Establishing Persistence via Windows Task Scheduler**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is a process that creates a scheduled task.  
   - Set the `dstNode` to reflect the scheduled task being created, which should include a command to run a suspicious binary.  
   - Ensure the `relation` is set to "Process Create" for the process responsible for creating the scheduled task.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe",
         "Cmdline": "schtasks /create /tn \"MaliciousTask\" /tr \"C:\\Path\\To\\SuspiciousBinary.exe\" /sc onlogon",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "MaliciousTask",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
