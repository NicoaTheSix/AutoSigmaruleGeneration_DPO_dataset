1. **Identify User Interaction with Malicious Attachment**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is an email application (e.g., Outlook) and the `dstNode` is an attachment file (e.g., a document with macros).  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the email application process.  
   - Additionally, track user actions that indicate enabling macros, which may not have a direct event but can be inferred from subsequent file access events.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Name": "Outlook",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "malicious_document_with_macros.docm",
         "Type": "File"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
