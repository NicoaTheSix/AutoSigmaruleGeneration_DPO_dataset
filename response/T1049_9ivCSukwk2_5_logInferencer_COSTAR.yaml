1. **Identify Establishing Persistence via Windows Task Scheduler**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is a process that creates a scheduled task.  
   - Set the `dstNode` to reflect the scheduled task entry created, which should include a command to execute a suspicious executable.  
   - Ensure the `relation` is set to "Process Create" for the process that initiates the task creation.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Path\\To\\SuspiciousExecutable.exe",
         "Cmdline": "C:\\Path\\To\\SuspiciousExecutable.exe -createTask",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "NewScheduledTask",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
