1. **Framework Section**  
   **Phase 1: Disabling Security Mechanisms**  
   - Identify and terminate processes associated with security tools (e.g., antivirus, EDR).  
   - Modify or delete registry keys related to security software functionality (e.g., HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall).  
   - Use scripts or commands to disable security services (e.g., `taskkill`, `Stop-Service`).  

   **Phase 2: Tampering with Security Configurations**  
   - Alter configuration files or settings to prevent security tools from operating correctly (e.g., modifying exclusion lists).  
   - Change system settings to lower security thresholds (e.g., Internet Explorer security settings).  
   - Disable automatic updates for security tools to prevent patching (e.g., modifying update settings in registry).  

   **Phase 3: Evasion Techniques**  
   - Implement API hooking or patching to bypass security features (e.g., AMSI bypass).  
   - Use legitimate tools or drivers to disable security mechanisms (e.g., GMER for anti-rootkit functionality).  
   - Create suspended processes to manipulate security software without detection (e.g., creating a suspended process for antivirus).  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Termination of Security Processes  
     - Examples: "Agent Tesla has the capability to kill any running analysis processes and AV software."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Registry Modification for Security Tools  
     - Examples: "JPIN can lower security settings by changing Registry keys."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Disabling Security Services  
     - Examples: "BlackByte Ransomware terminates and removes the Raccine anti-ransomware utility."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Configuration File Alteration  
     - Examples: "During the 2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack, Sandworm Team modified in-registry internet settings to lower internet security."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: API Hooking and Patching  
     - Examples: "Turlahas used an AMSI bypass, which patches the in-memory amsi.dll, in PowerShell scripts to bypass Windows antimalware products."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Legitimate Tools for Evasion  
     - Examples: "Agrius used a publicly available driver, GMER64.sys typically used for anti-rootkit functionality, to selectively stop and remove security software processes."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Exclusion List Manipulation  
     - Examples: "BlackByte Ransomware adds .JS and .EXE extensions to the Microsoft Defender exclusion list."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Disabling Automatic Updates  
     - Examples: "Ember Bear uses the NirSoft AdvancedRun utility to disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus through stopping the WinDefend service on victim machines."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Direct Manipulation of Security Features  
     - Examples: "Kimsuky has been observed turning off Windows Security Center and can hide the AV software window from the view of the infected user."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001
