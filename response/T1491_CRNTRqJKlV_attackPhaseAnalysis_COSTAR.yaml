1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Content Manipulation*  
   - Analyze changes to visual content across internal and external platforms.  
   - Monitor for unauthorized modifications to web pages, documents, or media files.  
   - Review logs for access patterns that indicate potential tampering with content.  

   Phase 2: *Integrity Verification*  
   - Implement checksums or hashes to verify the integrity of critical files and content.  
   - Conduct regular audits of content to identify unauthorized changes.  
   - Utilize anomaly detection to flag unusual content modifications or access behaviors.  

   Phase 3: *Incident Response*  
   - Develop and test incident response plans specifically for content defacement scenarios.  
   - Ensure that backup procedures are in place and regularly tested for effectiveness.  
   - Train personnel on recognizing and reporting signs of content manipulation.
