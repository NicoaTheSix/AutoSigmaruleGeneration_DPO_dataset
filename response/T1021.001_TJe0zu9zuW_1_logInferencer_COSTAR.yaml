1. **Identify User Interaction with Malicious Attachment in Outlook**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is the Outlook application and the `dstNode` is an attachment file (e.g., "malicious_macro.docm").  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the Outlook process when the user opens the email and clicks on the attachment.  
   - Additionally, monitor for events indicating that the user has enabled macros within the attachment.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Name": "Outlook",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "malicious_macro.docm",
         "Type": "File"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
2. **Monitor for Macro Enabling Events**  
   - Track events where the `srcNode` is the attachment file (e.g., "malicious_macro.docm") and the action indicates that macros have been enabled.  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the process that executes the macro.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\WINWORD.EXE",
         "Cmdline": "WINWORD.EXE \"C:\\path\\to\\malicious_macro.docm\"",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "malicious_macro.docm",
         "Type": "File"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
