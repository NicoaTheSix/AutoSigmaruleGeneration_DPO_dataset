1. **Identify Execution of Malicious Payload**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is Windows Explorer (e.g., `Image` contains "explorer.exe").  
   - Set the `dstNode` to the executable file named "payload.exe" located in the Downloads folder.  
   - Ensure the `relation` is set to "Process Create" for the Windows Explorer process.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Users\\<username>\\Downloads\\payload.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
