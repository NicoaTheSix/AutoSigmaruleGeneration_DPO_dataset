1. **Identify Spearphishing Attachment Delivery**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is an email application (e.g., Outlook) and the `dstNode` is an attachment with the name "Invoice.docx".  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the email application process.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Name": "Outlook",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "Invoice.docx",
         "Type": "File"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```

2. **Detect User Action on Malicious Attachment**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is the userâ€™s action (e.g., opening the attachment) and the `dstNode` is the Microsoft Office application (e.g., winword.exe).  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the Microsoft Office application process.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Name": "User Action",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\WINWORD.EXE",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```

3. **Monitor Macro Execution**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is the Microsoft Office application (e.g., winword.exe) and the `dstNode` is a script or executable that is downloaded as a result of the macro execution.  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the downloaded payload process.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\Office16\\WINWORD.EXE",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\malicious_payload.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```

4. **Establish Persistence**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is the downloaded payload process and the `dstNode` is a registry key or scheduled task that the payload attempts to create for persistence.  
   - Set the `relation` to "RegCreateKey" or "Process Create" depending on the persistence mechanism used.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Users\\User\\Downloads\\malicious_payload.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Key": "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\MaliciousApp",
         "Type": "Registry"
       },
       "relation": "RegCreateKey"
     }
     ```
