1. **Identify User Interaction with Malicious Attachment in Outlook**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is an email application (e.g., Outlook) and the `dstNode` is an attachment that is opened by the user.  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the email application process.  
   - Additionally, monitor for events indicating that the user has enabled macros within the attachment.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Name": "Outlook",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "MaliciousAttachment.docm",
         "Type": "File"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
   - Include a separate event for enabling macros, which may involve monitoring for specific registry changes or process interactions related to macro execution.
