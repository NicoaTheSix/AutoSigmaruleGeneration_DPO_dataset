1. **Framework Section**  
   **Phase 1: Code Injection Preparation**  
   - Identify target processes for injection (e.g., Explorer.exe, Notepad.exe)  
   - Utilize Windows API calls such as `VirtualAllocEx` and `WriteProcessMemory` to allocate and write code into the target process's memory  
   - Analyze the use of shellcode or other payloads that may be injected  

   **Phase 2: Code Execution**  
   - Invoke the injected code using `CreateRemoteThread` or similar methods  
   - Monitor for the creation of new threads within the target process  
   - Assess the impact of the injected code on the target process's behavior and resource access  

   **Phase 3: Evasion Techniques**  
   - Examine process behavior to identify potential evasion of security products  
   - Investigate the use of legitimate processes to mask malicious activity  
   - Analyze memory remapping techniques used to maintain functionality of injected code  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Process Targeting  
     - Examples: "Brute Ratel C4 has injected Latrodectus into the Explorer.exe process"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Direct Injection  
     - Examples: "Carbanak downloads an executable and injects it directly into a new process"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Payload Injection  
     - Examples: "DUSTPAN can inject its decrypted payload into another process"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Memory Execution  
     - Examples: "Gootloader can use its own PE loader to execute payloads in memory"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Remote Access Tool Injection  
     - Examples: "Gorgon Group malware can download a remote access tool, ShiftyBug, and inject into another process"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Backdoor Injection  
     - Examples: "InvisiMole can inject its backdoor as a portable executable into a target process"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Hardcoded Process Injection  
     - Examples: "Pikabot, following payload decryption, creates a process hard-coded into the dropped (e.g., WerFault.exe) and injects the decrypted core modules into it"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Evasion through Legitimate Processes  
     - Examples: "Rocke's miner, 'TermsHost.exe', evaded defenses by injecting itself into Windows processes, including Notepad.exe"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Conditional Injection  
     - Examples: "Zeus Panda checks processes on the system and if they meet the necessary requirements, it injects into that process"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002
