1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Discovery*  
   - Identify services running on remote hosts and local network infrastructure devices.  
   - Utilize tools for port scanning and service enumeration (e.g., Nmap, WinEggDrop).  
   - Conduct OS fingerprinting to determine the operating systems of discovered services.  

   Phase 2: *Vulnerability Assessment*  
   - Assess discovered services for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using vulnerability scanners like SMBTouch).  
   - Perform targeted scans for specific vulnerabilities (e.g., EternalBlue) on identified services.  
   - Analyze results from scans to prioritize targets based on exposure and risk.  

   Phase 3: *Exploitation Preparation*  
   - Gather information on open ports and services to plan potential exploitation.  
   - Map out network topology based on discovered services and their configurations.  
   - Identify weak points in the network that could be leveraged for further attacks.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Port Scanning  
     - Examples: "Agrius used the open-source port scanner WinEggDrop to perform detailed scans of hosts of interest in victim networks."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Service Enumeration  
     - Examples: "BlackByte has used tools such as NetScan to enumerate network services in victim environments."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Vulnerability Scanning  
     - Examples: "BackdoorDiplomacy has used SMBTouch, a vulnerability scanner, to determine whether a target is vulnerable to EternalBlue malware."  
     - Associated Phase: Vulnerability Assessment  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: OS Fingerprinting  
     - Examples: "APT32 performed network scanning on the network to search for open ports, services, OS fingerprinting, and other vulnerabilities."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Network Mapping  
     - Examples: "Industroyer uses a custom port scanner to map out a network."  
     - Associated Phase: Exploitation Preparation  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Targeted Scanning  
     - Examples: "Lazarus Group has used nmap from a router VM to scan ports on systems within the restricted segment of an enterprise network."  
     - Associated Phase: Vulnerability Assessment  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Service Discovery in Cloud Environments  
     - Examples: "Team TNT has also used malware that utilizes zmap and zgrab to search for vulnerable services in cloud environments."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046
