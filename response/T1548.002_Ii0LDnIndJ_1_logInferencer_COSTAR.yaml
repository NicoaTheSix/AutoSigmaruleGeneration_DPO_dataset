1. **Identify User Interaction with Malicious Attachment in Outlook**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is an email application (e.g., Outlook) and the `dstNode` is an attachment (e.g., a macro-enabled document).  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the email application process.  
   - Additionally, monitor for events indicating that the user has enabled macros within the document.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Name": "Outlook",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "malicious_document.xlsm",
         "Type": "File"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
   - Ensure to capture the event where the user clicks "Enable Content" to allow macros, which may be logged as a specific action within the application.
