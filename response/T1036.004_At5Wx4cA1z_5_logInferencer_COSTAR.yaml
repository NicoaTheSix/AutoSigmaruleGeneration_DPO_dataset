1. **Identify Service Creation for Persistence**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is a process responsible for creating a new service (e.g., `sc.exe` or `powershell.exe`).  
   - Set the `dstNode` to reflect the new service being created, ensuring the `Name` is similar to a legitimate service (e.g., "Windows Update Service").  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the service creation process.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\sc.exe",
         "Cmdline": "sc create WindowsUpdateService binPath= \"C:\\Path\\To\\Malicious.exe\"",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "WindowsUpdateService",
         "Type": "Registry" // Assuming the service is registered in the registry
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
