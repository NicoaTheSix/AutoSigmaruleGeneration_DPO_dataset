1. **Identify Command and Control Communication via PowerShell**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is a PowerShell process.  
   - Set the `relation` to "TCP Connect" for outbound network connections.  
   - Ensure the `dstNode` has a `Dstaddress` matching "http://malicious.com/c2" or other known malicious domains.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe",
         "Cmdline": "powershell.exe -Command ...",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Dstaddress": "malicious.com",
         "Port": 80,
         "Type": "Network"
       },
       "relation": "TCP Connect"
     }
     ```
