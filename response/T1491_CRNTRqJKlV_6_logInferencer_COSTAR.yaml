1. **Identify Scheduled Task Creation for Persistence**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is a process that creates a scheduled task.  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the process responsible for creating the scheduled task.  
   - Ensure the `dstNode` reflects the scheduled task entry created, which should point to the malicious payload executable.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Path\\To\\MaliciousExecutable.exe",
         "Cmdline": "C:\\Path\\To\\MaliciousExecutable.exe -createTask",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "MaliciousScheduledTask",
         "Type": "Registry" // Assuming the scheduled task is stored in the registry
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
2. **Validate User Privileges**  
   - Ensure that the creation of the scheduled task is performed by a non-administrative user.  
   - This can be validated by checking the user context under which the `srcNode` is running.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "User": "NonAdminUser",
         "Type": "Process"
       }
     }
     ```
3. **Map Unusual Executables**  
   - Identify the `dstNode` executable path to ensure it points to an unusual or suspicious executable.  
   - This can be done by maintaining a list of known good executables and comparing against the `dstNode.Image`.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "dstNode": {
         "Image": "C:\\Unusual\\Path\\To\\Executable.exe",
         "Type": "Process"
       }
     }
     ```
