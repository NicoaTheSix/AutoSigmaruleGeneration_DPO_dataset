1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Data Discovery*  
   - Identify and enumerate local files of interest using command-line tools (e.g., `cmd`, `PowerShell`, `forfiles`).  
   - Search for specific file types or extensions that may contain sensitive information (e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`, `.xls`).  
   - Access and query local databases or configuration files for sensitive data.  

   Phase 2: *Data Collection*  
   - Utilize automated scripts or tools to gather files from the local system (e.g., RATs, custom scripts).  
   - Collect data from user directories and system logs, including event logs using utilities like `wevtutil`.  
   - Stage collected files in a temporary location for potential exfiltration.  

   Phase 3: *Data Exfiltration*  
   - Upload collected files to a command and control (C2) server using various protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP).  
   - Use backdoors or remote access tools to facilitate the transfer of sensitive data.  
   - Implement obfuscation or encryption techniques to hide the exfiltration process from detection.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: File Enumeration  
     - Examples: "Fox Kitten has searched local system resources to access sensitive documents."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Automated Data Collection  
     - Examples: "Action RAT can collect local data from an infected machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Staging  
     - Examples: "APT28 has retrieved internal documents from machines inside victim environments, including by using Forfiles to stage documents before exfiltration."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Data Exfiltration via Upload  
     - Examples: "Lazarus Group has collected data and files from compromised networks."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Command-Line Tools for Exfiltration  
     - Examples: "QakBot can use a variety of commands, including esentutl.exe to steal sensitive data."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Type Filtering  
     - Examples: "BADNEWScrawls the victim's local drives and collects documents with the following extensions: .doc, .docx, .pdf, .ppt, .pptx, and .txt."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Backdoors for Data Retrieval  
     - Examples: "Hydra creates a backdoor through which remote attackers can read data from files."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005
