1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Credential Acquisition*  
   - Focus on monitoring for suspicious credential access techniques (e.g., keylogging, credential dumping).  
   - Analyze logs for failed login attempts and unusual account access patterns.  
   - Investigate the use of tools known for credential harvesting (e.g., Mimikatz, RDP credential stealers).  

   Phase 2: *Remote Access Establishment*  
   - Detect RDP connection attempts from unusual IP addresses or geographic locations.  
   - Monitor for the enabling of RDP services on systems, especially on non-standard ports.  
   - Analyze network traffic for tunneling protocols or unusual RDP traffic patterns.  

   Phase 3: *Lateral Movement and Persistence*  
   - Track RDP session activity across the network, focusing on session initiation and termination logs.  
   - Monitor for the use of known persistence mechanisms related to RDP (e.g., enabling RDP on startup).  
   - Investigate file transfers or command executions initiated through RDP sessions.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Credential Harvesting  
     - Examples: "Agrius tunnels RDP traffic through deployed web shells to access victim environments via compromised accounts."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP Connection Establishment  
     - Examples: "APT41 used NAT Bypass to expose local RDP ports on compromised systems to the Internet."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Lateral Movement via RDP  
     - Examples: "FIN10 has used RDP to move laterally to systems in the victim environment."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP for Persistence  
     - Examples: "APT3 enables the Remote Desktop Protocol for persistence."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Remote File Transfer  
     - Examples: "Blue Mockingbird has used Remote Desktop to log on to servers interactively and manually copy files to remote hosts."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: RDP Session Management  
     - Examples: "APT39 has been seen using RDP for lateral movement and persistence, in some cases employing the rdpwinst tool for management of multiple sessions."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1021.001
