1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Initial Access*  
   - Focus on detection of spearphishing emails containing malicious attachments.  
   - Monitor for user interactions with files that have common extensions (.doc, .pdf, .xls, .exe, etc.).  
   - Analyze email headers and content for signs of social engineering tactics.  

   Phase 2: *Execution*  
   - Track execution of files that require user interaction, such as enabling macros or executing scripts.  
   - Monitor for processes initiated by user actions on malicious files (e.g., opening a .doc with macros).  
   - Identify and log any changes to system files or registry keys that occur after a user opens a malicious file.  

   Phase 3: *Post-Execution*  
   - Analyze network traffic for unusual outbound connections following file execution.  
   - Monitor for persistence mechanisms that may be established after initial execution (e.g., scheduled tasks, startup items).  
   - Review logs for any abnormal behavior or commands executed post-infection.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Spearphishing with Malicious Attachments  
     - Examples: "admin@338 has attempted to get victims to launch malicious Microsoft Word attachments delivered via spearphishing emails."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Macro Execution Prompt  
     - Examples: "APT38 has attempted to lure victims into enabling malicious macros within email attachments."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: User Interaction for Execution  
     - Examples: "Cobalt Group has sent emails containing malicious attachments that require users to execute a file or macro to infect the victim machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Malicious File Types  
     - Examples: "Aoqin Dragon has lured victims into opening weaponized documents, fake external drives, and fake antivirus to execute malicious payloads."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Social Engineering Tactics  
     - Examples: "Dark Caracal makes their malware look like Flash Player, Office, or PDF documents in order to entice a user to click on it."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Post-Execution Network Activity  
     - Examples: "Emotet has relied upon users clicking on a malicious attachment delivered through spearphishing."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Persistence Mechanisms  
     - Examples: "FIN7 lured victims to double-click on images in the attachments they sent which would then execute the hidden LNK file."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002
