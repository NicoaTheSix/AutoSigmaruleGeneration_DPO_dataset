1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Service Discovery*  
   - Utilize OS utility commands (e.g., `net start`, `tasklist /svc`, `sc query`) to gather information about running services.  
   - Identify third-party services and their configurations to assess potential targets for further exploitation.  
   - Collect service-related data and log it for analysis to inform follow-on actions.  

   Phase 2: *Information Analysis*  
   - Analyze the gathered service information to determine the presence of specific services that may indicate vulnerabilities or targets for privilege escalation.  
   - Correlate service data with known malicious behaviors or indicators of compromise (IOCs) to prioritize follow-up actions.  
   - Assess the operational context of services to understand their role in the system and potential impact on the adversary's objectives.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Command Execution for Service Enumeration  
     - Examples: `net start >> %temp%\download[1]`, `tasklist`, `sc query`  
     - Associated Phase: Service Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Targeting Third-Party Services  
     - Examples: "Aquatic Panda has attempted to discover services for third party EDR products."  
     - Associated Phase: Service Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Logging Service Information  
     - Examples: `net start >> %TEMP%\info.dat`  
     - Associated Phase: Service Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Analysis of Service Configurations  
     - Examples: "Gemini Duke collects information on programs and services on the victim that are configured to automatically run at startup."  
     - Associated Phase: Information Analysis  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Correlating Services with Malicious Activity  
     - Examples: "During Operation Cuckoo Bees, the threat actors used the net start command as part of their initial reconnaissance."  
     - Associated Phase: Information Analysis  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Privilege Escalation via Service Manipulation  
     - Examples: "SILENTTRINITY can search for modifiable services that could be used for privilege escalation."  
     - Associated Phase: Information Analysis  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007
