1. **Identify User Interaction with Email Attachments**  
   - Monitor for events where the `srcNode` is an email application (e.g., Outlook) and the `dstNode` is an attachment file (e.g., any file type that could contain macros).  
   - Set the `relation` to "Process Create" for the email application process when the user opens the email and clicks on the attachment.  
   - Additionally, monitor for events indicating that the user has enabled macros within the attachment.  
   - Example:  
     ```json
     {
       "srcNode": {
         "Name": "Outlook",
         "Type": "Process"
       },
       "dstNode": {
         "Name": "Attachment_File_With_Macros.docm",
         "Type": "File"
       },
       "relation": "Process Create"
     }
     ```
