1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Delivery*  
   - Analyze email headers for spoofing indicators (e.g., "From" address discrepancies).  
   - Monitor for common file types associated with spearphishing (e.g., .docx, .xls, .pdf, .zip).  
   - Identify patterns in email content that suggest social engineering tactics (e.g., urgency, authority).  

   Phase 2: *Execution*  
   - Detect execution of files with suspicious extensions or macros (e.g., .exe, .scr, .chm).  
   - Monitor for user interactions with email attachments (e.g., opening files, bypassing security prompts).  
   - Analyze process creation and command-line arguments for known malicious behaviors (e.g., exploitation of vulnerabilities).  

   Phase 3: *Post-Execution*  
   - Investigate network connections initiated by newly executed processes (e.g., C2 communications).  
   - Monitor for persistence mechanisms employed by malware (e.g., registry modifications, scheduled tasks).  
   - Analyze file system changes for indicators of compromise (e.g., creation of new executables or scripts).  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Email Spoofing
