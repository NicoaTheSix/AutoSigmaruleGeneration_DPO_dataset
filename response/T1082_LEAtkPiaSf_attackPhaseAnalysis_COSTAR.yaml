1. **Framework Section**  
   **Phase 1: Information Gathering**  
   - Analyze system commands and tools used for information retrieval (e.g., `systeminfo`, `ver`, `uname`, `df`).
   - Monitor API calls and scripts that query system details (e.g., WMI queries, `esxcli` commands).
   - Identify artifacts related to system information collection (e.g., temporary files created during data collection).

   **Phase 2: Data Exfiltration**  
   - Track network communications that send system information to command and control (C2) servers.
   - Monitor for file creation or modification events that indicate data packaging for exfiltration (e.g., files in `%temp%`).
   - Analyze beaconing behavior that includes system information in its payload.

   **Phase 3: Follow-on Actions**  
   - Investigate subsequent actions taken based on gathered system information (e.g., targeted malware deployment).
   - Identify changes in system state or configuration that correlate with prior information gathering (e.g., new processes or services).
   - Monitor for indicators of further exploitation based on the system profile (e.g., privilege escalation attempts).

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: OS Version Identification  
     - Examples: "4H RAT sends an OS version identifier in its beacons."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: System Information Collection via Commands  
     - Examples: "admin@338 actors used the following commands after exploiting a machine with LOWBALL malware to obtain information about the OS: ver >> %temp%\download"  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: API-Based System Profiling  
     - Examples: "Agent Tesla can collect the system's computer name and also has the capability to collect information on the processor, memory, OS, and video card from the system."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Data Transmission to C2  
     - Examples: "Felismus collects the system information, including hostname and OS version, and sends it to the C2 server."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: System Configuration Changes  
     - Examples: "During its initial execution, BACKSPACE extracts operating system information from the infected host."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Drive Enumeration  
     - Examples: "Bazar can fingerprint architecture, computer name, and OS version on the compromised host."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Command Execution for System Details  
     - Examples: "APT32 has collected the OS version and computer name from victims."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082  

   - **Pattern Name**: Unique Victim Identifier Creation  
     - Examples: "Ramsay can detect system information--including disk names, total space, and remaining space--to create a hardware profile GUID which acts as a system identifier for operators."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1082
