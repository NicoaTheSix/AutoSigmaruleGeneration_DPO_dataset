1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Data Discovery*  
   - Identify and enumerate local file systems and directories for files of interest.  
   - Utilize command-line interfaces (e.g., cmd, PowerShell) to search for specific file types or sensitive data.  
   - Access and query local databases or configuration files for sensitive information.  

   Phase 2: *Data Collection*  
   - Execute scripts or commands to gather identified files and data from the local system.  
   - Use automated collection tools or malware capabilities to extract files based on predefined criteria (e.g., file extensions).  
   - Stage collected data in a temporary location for potential exfiltration.  

   Phase 3: *Data Exfiltration*  
   - Transfer collected files to external command and control (C2) servers or other external locations.  
   - Utilize various protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP) or backdoor mechanisms to facilitate data transfer.  
   - Implement anti-forensics techniques to obscure the collection and exfiltration process.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Local File Enumeration  
     - Examples: "Fox Kitten has searched local system resources to access sensitive documents."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Automated Data Collection  
     - Examples: "Action RAT can collect local data from an infected machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Type Specific Collection  
     - Examples: "BADNEWScrawls the victim's local drives and collects documents with the following extensions: .doc, .docx, .pdf, .ppt, .pptx, and .txt."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Data Staging for Exfiltration  
     - Examples: "APT28 has retrieved internal documents from machines inside victim environments, including by using Forfiles to stage documents before exfiltration."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Data Exfiltration via C2  
     - Examples: "Lazarus Group has collected data and files from compromised networks."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Anti-Forensics Techniques  
     - Examples: "Agrius gathered data from database and other critical servers in victim environments, then used wiping mechanisms as an anti-analysis and anti-forensics mechanism."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005
