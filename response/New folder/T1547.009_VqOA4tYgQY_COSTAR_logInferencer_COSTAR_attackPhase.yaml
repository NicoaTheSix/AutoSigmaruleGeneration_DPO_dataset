1. **Title**: Detect Malicious Shortcut Creation for Persistence  
   **Details**: Monitor for the creation of a .LNK file in the Startup folder. Target the `dstNode` with `Type` set to "File" and `relation` as "CreateFile". The `dstNode` should have `Name` containing "malicious.lnk" and `Cmdline` indicating the execution of a payload (e.g., "C:\\Path\\To\\Malicious\\Payload.exe"). Ensure the `srcNode` is a script or process that creates this shortcut.

2. **Title**: Identify Modification of Existing Shortcuts  
   **Details**: Track modifications to existing shortcuts in the Start Menu. Set `dstNode` with `Type` as "File" and `relation` as "WriteFile". The `dstNode` should have `Name` matching a legitimate application (e.g., "LegitimateApp.lnk") and `Cmdline` indicating the new target path (e.g., "C:\\Path\\To\\Malicious\\Payload.exe"). The `srcNode` should be a script or process that performs this modification.

3. **Title**: Monitor Execution of Malicious Shortcuts  
   **Details**: Capture events where a .LNK file is executed. Set `dstNode` with `Type` as "Process" and `relation` as "Process Create". The `dstNode` should have `Image` indicating the malicious payload (e.g., "C:\\Path\\To\\Malicious\\Payload.exe") and `Cmdline` reflecting the execution of this payload. The `srcNode` should be the shortcut (e.g., "malicious.lnk") that triggers this execution.

4. **Title**: Detect Registry Run Key Creation for Persistence  
   **Details**: Monitor for the creation of Registry Run keys. Set `dstNode` with `Type` as "Registry" and `relation` as "RegSetValue". The `dstNode` should have `Key` matching "HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run" and `Name` indicating the malicious shortcut (e.g., "MaliciousShortcut"). The `srcNode` should be the process that executes the command to add this key.

5. **Title**: Identify Repeated Execution of Malicious Shortcuts  
   **Details**: Track repeated executions of a .LNK file. Set `dstNode` with `Type` as "Process" and `relation` as "Process Create". The `dstNode` should have `Image` indicating the malicious payload and `Cmdline` showing the invocation of this payload. Ensure that the `timestamp` reflects multiple occurrences, indicating persistence.

6. **Title**: Monitor for Browser Shortcut Modifications  
   **Details**: Detect modifications to browser shortcuts. Set `dstNode` with `Type` as "File" and `relation` as "WriteFile". The `dstNode` should have `Name` matching the browser shortcut (e.g., "Browser.lnk") and `Cmdline` indicating the new target path (e.g., "C:\\Path\\To\\Malicious\\Extension.exe"). The `srcNode` should be the script or process that performs this modification.

7. **Title**: Detect Use of Masquerading Techniques  
   **Details**: Monitor for the creation of disguised shortcuts. Set `dstNode` with `Type` as "File" and `relation` as "CreateFile". The `dstNode` should have `Name` resembling a legitimate application (e.g., "Office Start.lnk") and `Cmdline` indicating the malicious payload. The `srcNode` should be the process that creates this shortcut.
