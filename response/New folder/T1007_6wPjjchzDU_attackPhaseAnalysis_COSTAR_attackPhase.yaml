1. **Framework Section**  
   **Phase 1: Service Discovery**  
   - Utilize OS utility commands (e.g., `net start`, `tasklist /svc`, `sc query`) to gather information about running services.  
   - Analyze service configurations and statuses to identify potential targets for further exploitation.  
   - Collect output data from service enumeration commands for later analysis or automated processes.  

   **Phase 2: Information Utilization**  
   - Assess the gathered service information to determine the presence of security products or critical services.  
   - Shape follow-on actions based on the discovered services, such as targeting specific services for privilege escalation or lateral movement.  
   - Document findings to inform future operations or to refine attack strategies.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Command Execution for Service Enumeration  
     - Examples: `net start >> %temp%\download[1]`, `tasklist`, `sc query`  
     - Associated Phase: Service Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Targeting Security Products  
     - Examples: "Aquatic Panda has attempted to discover services for third party EDR products."  
     - Associated Phase: Information Utilization  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Service Configuration Querying  
     - Examples: "BBSRAT can query service configuration information."  
     - Associated Phase: Service Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Service Status Retrieval  
     - Examples: "Cubacan query service status using QueryServiceStatusEx function."  
     - Associated Phase: Service Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Automated Service Discovery  
     - Examples: "During Operation Cuckoo Bees, the threat actors used the net start command as part of their initial reconnaissance."  
     - Associated Phase: Information Utilization  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Service Enumeration for Privilege Escalation  
     - Examples: "SILENTTRINITY can search for modifiable services that could be used for privilege escalation."  
     - Associated Phase: Information Utilization  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007  

   - **Pattern Name**: Collecting Service Information  
     - Examples: "TrickBot collects a list of install programs and services on the systemâ€™s machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Service Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1007
