1. **Title**: Monitor for Spearphishing Email Attachments  
   **Details**: Identify email logs where the sender's address is from an external domain and the attachment has a `.docm` extension. This indicates a potential spearphishing attempt.  

2. **Title**: Detect Process Creation from Outlook to Word  
   **Details**: Map process creation events where `WINWORD.EXE` is initiated by `OUTLOOK.EXE` with a `.docm` file in the command line. This indicates that a user has opened a potentially malicious Word document.  

3. **Title**: Track Macro Execution in Microsoft Word  
   **Details**: Monitor logs for macro execution events within Microsoft Word documents, specifically looking for `VBAProject` execution logs. This indicates that a macro has been enabled and executed, potentially leading to malicious activity.  

4. **Title**: Capture PowerShell Command Execution  
   **Details**: Track PowerShell command logs that show execution of `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Start-Process` commands. This indicates that a macro may have executed a command to download and run a malicious payload.  

5. **Title**: Monitor Registry Modifications for Persistence  
   **Details**: Identify registry changes in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` that add new entries. This indicates that a payload is attempting to establish persistence on the system.  

6. **Title**: Analyze Network Traffic for C2 Communication  
   **Details**: Monitor network logs for outbound connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains. This indicates that the compromised system is attempting to communicate with an attacker's command and control server.  

7. **Title**: Detect Malicious Macro Execution in Excel  
   **Details**: Identify process creation events where `EXCEL.EXE` is initiated by `OUTLOOK.EXE` with a `.xlsm` file in the command line. This indicates that a user has opened a potentially malicious Excel document.  

8. **Title**: Capture JavaScript File Execution from ZIP Extraction  
   **Details**: Track file system logs showing extraction events from ZIP files and the creation of JavaScript files in user directories. This indicates that a user has extracted a potentially malicious JavaScript file.  

9. **Title**: Monitor for Execution of Malicious Installers  
   **Details**: Identify instances where executable files (e.g., `Setup.exe`) are run from user directories. This indicates that a user has executed a potentially malicious installer.  

10. **Title**: Detect Double Extension Files  
    **Details**: Monitor for emails with attachments that have double extensions (e.g., `.pdf.exe`). This indicates a potential file type masquerading attempt to trick users into executing malicious files.  

11. **Title**: Track Outbound Connections to Malicious URLs  
    **Details**: Analyze network traffic for unusual outbound connections, particularly to newly established domains or IPs. This indicates that a compromised system may be attempting to download additional malicious payloads.  

12. **Title**: Monitor for PDF File Open Events  
    **Details**: Identify process creation logs showing `AcroRd32.exe` initiated by `OUTLOOK.EXE` with a PDF file. This indicates that a user has opened a potentially malicious PDF document.  

13. **Title**: Capture User Interaction with Malicious Attachments  
    **Details**: Monitor for emails with attachments that originate from external sources, particularly those that are password-protected ZIP files. This indicates a potential obfuscated file delivery attempt.  

14. **Title**: Track PowerShell Commands from JavaScript Execution  
    **Details**: Monitor PowerShell command logs showing execution of `Invoke-WebRequest` from JavaScript files. This indicates that a JavaScript file may be executing a command to download a malicious payload.  

15. **Title**: Monitor for Registry Changes Related to Persistence  
    **Details**: Identify registry modifications that add new entries for persistence, especially those related to recently executed applications. This indicates that a payload is attempting to maintain persistence on the system.
