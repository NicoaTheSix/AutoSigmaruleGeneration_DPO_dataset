Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a victim's system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, involving email clients, web browsers, and office applications, ultimately leading to the execution of a payload that compromises the victim's machine.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The victim receives a spearphishing email containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment filename (e.g., `Invoice.docx`).
   - **Loggable Events**:
     - Email received event in Outlook logs.
     - Attachment download event in Outlook logs.

   ```shell
   # Log event indicating the email was received
   Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source Outlook -After (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-5)
   ```

2. **Opening the Malicious Attachment**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word
   - **User Action**: The victim opens the attachment, triggering macros that download a malicious payload.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Macro-enabled document (e.g., `Invoice.docm`).
   - **Loggable Events**:
     - Document opened event in Word logs.
     - Macro execution event in Word logs.

   ```shell
   # Log event indicating the document was opened
   Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source Winword -After (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-5)
   ```

3. **Payload Download via Web Browser**
   - **Application Involved**: Internet Explorer/Edge
   - **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command that downloads a malicious executable from a remote server.
   - **Key Artifacts**: URL of the malicious payload (e.g., `http://malicious.com/payload.exe`).
   - **Loggable Events**:
     - HTTP request logs showing the download of the executable.
     - PowerShell command execution logs.

   ```shell
   # Log event indicating a PowerShell command was executed
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" }
   ```

4. **Execution of the Malicious Payload**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell
   - **User Action**: The downloaded executable is executed, establishing a reverse shell to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Executable file (e.g., `payload.exe`), C2 server IP address.
   - **Loggable Events**:
     - Process creation logs showing the execution of the malicious executable.
     - Network connection logs indicating outbound traffic to the C2 server.

   ```shell
   # Log event indicating a new process was created
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Security | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 4688 -and $_.Message -like "*payload.exe*" }
   ```

5. **Establishing Command and Control**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell/Network
   - **User Action**: The payload communicates with the C2 server to receive further instructions.
   - **Key Artifacts**: C2 communication logs, command execution logs.
   - **Loggable Events**:
     - Network logs showing connections to the C2 server.
     - PowerShell logs indicating commands received from the C2.

   ```shell
   # Log event indicating a network connection to the C2 server
   Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.RemoteAddress -eq "malicious.com" }
   ```

6. **Post-Exploitation Activities**
   - **Application Involved**: Various (e.g., cmd.exe, PowerShell)
   - **User Action**: The attacker executes further commands to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Command history, additional payloads.
   - **Loggable Events**:
     - Command execution logs showing suspicious commands.
     - User account changes or privilege escalation logs.

   ```shell
   # Log event indicating suspicious command execution
   Get-WinEvent -LogName Security | Where-Object { $_.Id -eq 4688 -and $_.Message -like "*cmd.exe*" }
   ```
