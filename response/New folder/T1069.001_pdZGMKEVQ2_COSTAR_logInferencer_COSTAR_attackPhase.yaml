1. **Identify Initial Access via Email**  
   - Map the detection of the email with the subject line "Important Document" and attachment "Invoice.xlsx". Look for unusual sender email addresses in email logs. This may not directly map to the provided schema but is crucial for initial detection.

2. **Monitor Opening of Malicious Attachment**  
   - Detect the execution of Microsoft Excel with the command line indicating the opening of "Invoice.xlsx". Look for logs that show Excel was executed with macros enabled. This can be inferred from process creation logs where `srcNode.Image` is "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\OfficeXX\\EXCEL.EXE" and `dstNode.Image` is "C:\\Users\\Victim\\Downloads\\Invoice.xlsx".

3. **Capture Macro Execution and Payload Download**  
   - Identify PowerShell execution initiated by Excel macros. Look for `srcNode.Image` as "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\OfficeXX\\EXCEL.EXE" and `dstNode.Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe". The `Cmdline` for PowerShell should include `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl` commands targeting suspicious URLs.

4. **Log Execution of the Malicious Payload**  
   - Detect the execution of the downloaded malicious executable "malicious.exe". The `srcNode.Image` should be "C:\\Windows\\explorer.exe" and `dstNode.Image` should be "C:\\Users\\Victim\\Downloads\\malicious.exe". Ensure to capture the process creation logs indicating this relationship.

5. **Track Command and Control Communication**  
   - Monitor outbound network connections initiated by the malicious executable. The `srcNode.Image` should be "C:\\Users\\Victim\\Downloads\\malicious.exe" and `dstNode.Type` should be "Network" with `relation` as "TCP Connect". Look for connections to known malicious IPs or domains in the `dstNode.Dstaddress`.

6. **Detect Data Exfiltration or Further Exploitation**  
   - Identify unusual outbound data transfers or access to sensitive files. This can be captured by monitoring network traffic logs for large data transfers or unusual file access patterns. The `relation` should be "TCP Send" for data exfiltration events. 

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive detection logic that maps directly to the provided event schema, facilitating the development of effective Sigma rules for this attack scenario.
