1. **Identify Initial Access via Email**  
   - Monitor for email logs that contain the subject line "Important Update" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".  
   - Reference the `srcNode` as the email application (e.g., Outlook) and the `dstNode` as the email attachment.  

2. **Map Opening of Malicious Attachment**  
   - Detect when the user opens the Excel attachment, specifically looking for logs indicating the execution of macros within the Excel file.  
   - Reference the `srcNode` as the Excel application and the `dstNode` as the Excel file with macros.  

3. **Validate Macro Execution and Payload Download**  
   - Monitor for PowerShell command logs that include the execution of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a remote server.  
   - Reference the `srcNode` as PowerShell and the `dstNode` as the downloaded executable file.  

4. **Detect Execution of the Malicious Payload**  
   - Identify outbound network connections initiated by the newly created executable that establish a reverse shell connection to a command and control (C2) server.  
   - Reference the `srcNode` as the malicious executable and the `dstNode` as the C2 server's IP address.  

5. **Monitor for Establishing Persistence**  
   - Track the creation of scheduled tasks that execute unusual executables, indicating persistence mechanisms being established.  
   - Reference the `srcNode` as the task scheduler and the `dstNode` as the scheduled task entry.  

6. **Identify Data Exfiltration Activities**  
   - Monitor network traffic logs for large outbound data transfers, particularly to known malicious IP addresses, indicating potential data exfiltration.  
   - Reference the `srcNode` as the PowerShell or web browser used for exfiltration and the `dstNode` as the destination IP address.
