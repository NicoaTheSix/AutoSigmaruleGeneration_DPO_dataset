1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *User Identification*  
   - Analyze system logs for user account access patterns.  
   - Monitor execution of commands such as `whoami`, `quser`, and `dscl` for user enumeration.  
   - Collect and review environment variables like `%USERNAME%` and `$USER` for user identification.  

   Phase 2: *Session Discovery*  
   - Track active sessions and user logins through commands like `show users` and `query user`.  
   - Investigate process ownership and file/directory ownership to correlate with user accounts.  
   - Examine network device logs for user access and session information.  

   Phase 3: *Privilege Assessment*  
   - Identify commands that check for user privileges, such as `cmd.exe /C whoami` and `whoami /all`.  
   - Analyze the execution of scripts or malware that assess user roles (e.g., admin vs. standard user).  
   - Review C2 communications for user privilege information sent back to the adversary.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: User Enumeration via Command Execution  
     - Examples: "APT32 collected the victim's username and executed the whoami command on the victim's machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1033  

   - **Pattern Name**: Session Information Retrieval  
     - Examples: "During Operation Wocao, threat actors enumerated sessions and users on a remote host."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1033  

   - **Pattern Name**: Privilege Level Assessment  
     - Examples: "Storm-1811 has used whoami.exe to determine if the active user on a compromised system is an administrator."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1033  

   - **Pattern Name**: Environment Variable Exploitation  
     - Examples: "Various Lazarus Group malware enumerates logged-on users."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1033  

   - **Pattern Name**: C2 Communication of User Information  
     - Examples: "Felismus collects the current username and sends it to the C2 server."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1033  

   - **Pattern Name**: User Account Discovery on Network Devices  
     - Examples: "Network Device CLI commands such as show users and show ssh can be used to display users currently logged into the device."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1033
