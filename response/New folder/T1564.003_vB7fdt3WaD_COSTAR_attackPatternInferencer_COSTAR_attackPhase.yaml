   - User Action: The user receives an email with a malicious attachment (e.g., `malicious_script.ps1`).
   - Key Artifact: Email headers, attachment file.

2. **Execution of Malicious PowerShell Script**
   - Application: PowerShell
   - User Action: The user opens the attachment, triggering the execution of the PowerShell script.
   - Command:
     ```powershell
     # Execute the PowerShell script with hidden window style
     powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Users\User\Downloads\malicious_script.ps1" -WindowStyle Hidden
     ```
   - Key Artifact: PowerShell process creation with hidden window style.

3. **Concealment of Activity**
   - Application: PowerShell
   - Behavior: The script performs actions such as downloading additional payloads or exfiltrating data while remaining hidden from the user.
   - Key Artifact: Network connections to command and control (C2) servers.

4. **Persistence Mechanism**
   - Application: Registry
   - Behavior: The script modifies the registry to ensure it runs at startup without user visibility.
   - Command:
     ```powershell
     # Add a registry key for persistence
     Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "MaliciousScript" -Value "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File 'C:\Path\To\malicious_script.ps1' -WindowStyle Hidden"
