1. **Identify Initial Access via Email**  
   - Monitor for email events where the sender's address matches known suspicious patterns (e.g., "admin@338").  
   - Reference the event schema to capture email headers and attachment details.  

2. **Map User Interaction with Malicious File**  
   - Detect events where a user opens a Microsoft Word document (e.g., "malicious_document.docx") and enables macros.  
   - Use the schema to track the application involved (Microsoft Word) and the action taken (e.g., enabling macros).  

3. **Validate Execution of Malicious Code**  
   - Look for PowerShell execution events that are initiated from Microsoft Word.  
   - Specifically, target events where the PowerShell command includes actions like "Invoke-WebRequest" or similar commands that indicate downloading or executing additional payloads.  

4. **Monitor for Persistence Mechanisms**  
   - Track the creation of new scheduled tasks by non-administrative users, which may indicate an attempt to establish persistence.  
   - Use the schema to capture the relation of the process creating the scheduled task and any associated registry modifications.  

5. **Investigate Exfiltration and C2 Communication**  
   - Analyze network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections initiated by PowerShell or web browsers.  
   - Focus on DNS queries to known malicious domains and capture relevant network event details in the schema.  

6. **Correlate All Stages for Comprehensive Detection**  
   - Ensure that detection logic correlates events across all stages of the attack flow, from initial access through to C2 communication.  
   - Utilize the schema to create a holistic view of the attack, linking processes, files, and network activities.  

7. **Document Detection Logic for Sigma Rule Creation**  
   - Compile the detection conditions into a structured format suitable for Sigma rule creation, ensuring clarity in the mapping of schema fields to the attack scenarios.  
   - Include specific examples of command lines or event IDs that should be monitored for each stage of the attack.
