1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Injection Preparation*  
   - Identify target processes for injection (e.g., Explorer.exe, WerFault.exe)  
   - Utilize Windows API calls such as `VirtualAllocEx` and `WriteProcessMemory` to allocate and write code into the target process's memory  
   - Prepare the injected code (e.g., shellcode or PE binary) for execution  

   Phase 2: *Execution of Injected Code*  
   - Invoke the injected code using `CreateRemoteThread` or similar methods  
   - Monitor for changes in the target process's behavior or memory usage  
   - Assess the impact of the injected code on system/network resources and privileges  

   Phase 3: *Evasion and Persistence*  
   - Analyze the execution context to ensure it remains masked under legitimate processes  
   - Implement techniques to avoid detection by security products  
   - Maintain access or establish persistence through the injected process  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Process Injection via PE  
     - Examples: "Brute Ratel C4 has injected Latrodectus into the Explorer.exe process"  
     - Associated Phase: Injection Preparation  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Direct Injection into New Process  
     - Examples: "Carbanak downloads an executable and injects it directly into a new process"  
     - Associated Phase: Execution of Injected Code  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Memory Injection with Decryption  
     - Examples: "Pikabot, following payload decryption, creates a process hard-coded into the dropped (e.g., WerFault.exe) and injects the decrypted core modules into it"  
     - Associated Phase: Execution of Injected Code  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Evasion through Process Injection  
     - Examples: "Rocke's miner, 'TermsHost.exe', evaded defenses by injecting itself into Windows processes, including Notepad.exe"  
     - Associated Phase: Evasion and Persistence  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Remote Access Tool Injection  
     - Examples: "Gorgon Group malware can download a remote access tool, ShiftyBug, and inject into another process"  
     - Associated Phase: Execution of Injected Code  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Backdoor Injection  
     - Examples: "InvisiMole can inject its backdoor as a portable executable into a target process"  
     - Associated Phase: Execution of Injected Code  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Process Requirement Check  
     - Examples: "Zeus Panda checks processes on the system and if they meet the necessary requirements, it injects into that process"  
     - Associated Phase: Injection Preparation  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1055.002
