1. **Identify Initial Access via Email**  
   - Monitor for events where Outlook is used to open an email with a specific subject line "Important Update" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".  
   - Target the `srcNode` with `Name` as "Outlook" and `relation` as "Process Create".

2. **Map Exploit Execution in Excel**  
   - Detect when the Excel application is launched with the attachment "Invoice_2023.xlsx".  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\OfficeXX\\EXCEL.EXE" (replace XX with the version number) and `dstNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Users\\Victim\\Downloads\\Invoice_2023.xlsx".  
   - Use `relation` as "Process Create".

3. **Validate PowerShell Command Execution**  
   - Look for PowerShell commands executed that include `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a URL (e.g., "http://malicious-website.com/payload.exe").  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe" and `dstNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Users\\Victim\\Downloads\\payload.exe".  
   - Use `relation` as "Process Create".

4. **Detect Scheduled Task Creation for Persistence**  
   - Monitor for the creation of a scheduled task that runs the payload executable at startup.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe" and `dstNode` with `Name` as "MaliciousTask".  
   - Use `relation` as "Process Create".

5. **Identify Data Exfiltration Preparation**  
   - Look for PowerShell commands that scan for sensitive files in the user's Documents folder and prepare them for exfiltration.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe" and `dstNode` with `Name` as "C:\\Temp\\StagedFiles\\".  
   - Use `relation` as "Process Create".

6. **Monitor Data Exfiltration Activity**  
   - Detect outbound network connections initiated by PowerShell to upload files to an external server.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe" and `dstNode` with `Dstaddress` as "malicious-website.com".  
   - Use `relation` as "TCP Connect".
