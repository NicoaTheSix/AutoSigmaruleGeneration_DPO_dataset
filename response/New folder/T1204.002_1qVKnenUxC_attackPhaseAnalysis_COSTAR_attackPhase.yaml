1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *User Interaction*  
   - Monitor for user actions involving opening files with extensions such as .doc, .pdf, .xls, .rtf, .scr, .exe, .lnk, .pif, .cpl, and .reg.  
   - Analyze email logs for spearphishing attempts that include attachments or links prompting user interaction.  
   - Detect social engineering tactics in communications that may lead to file execution.  

   Phase 2: *Execution*  
   - Identify processes initiated by user actions that involve executing macros or scripts from opened documents.  
   - Monitor for the creation of new processes or modifications to existing processes that occur immediately after a user opens a malicious file.  
   - Track file system changes, particularly in directories where malicious files are likely to be placed (e.g., desktop, shared folders).  

   Phase 3: *Persistence*  
   - Investigate registry keys and scheduled tasks that may be created as a result of executing malicious files.  
   - Look for signs of obfuscated files or masquerading techniques used to disguise malicious payloads.  
   - Analyze for any persistence mechanisms that may be established post-execution, such as creating startup entries or modifying system configurations.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Malicious Macro Execution  
     - Examples: "Sandworm Team leveraged Microsoft Office attachments which contained malicious macros that were automatically executed once the user permitted them."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Spearphishing Attachment Delivery  
     - Examples: "admin@338 has attempted to get victims to launch malicious Microsoft Word attachments delivered via spearphishing emails."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: User Prompt for Macro Enablement  
     - Examples: "APT38 has attempted to lure victims into enabling malicious macros within email attachments."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Execution via User Interaction  
     - Examples: "Cobalt Group has sent emails containing malicious attachments that require users to execute a file or macro to infect the victim machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Obfuscated File Delivery  
     - Examples: "Water Curupira Pikabot Distribution delivered Pikabot installers as password-protected ZIP files containing heavily obfuscated JavaScript."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Social Engineering Lures  
     - Examples: "Dark Caracal makes their malware look like Flash Player, Office, or PDF documents in order to entice a user to click on it."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Execution of Malicious Installers  
     - Examples: "AppleJeus has required user execution of a malicious MSI installer."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Type Masquerading  
     - Examples: "TA505 makes their malware look like legitimate Microsoft Word documents, .pdf and/or .lnk files."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1204.002
