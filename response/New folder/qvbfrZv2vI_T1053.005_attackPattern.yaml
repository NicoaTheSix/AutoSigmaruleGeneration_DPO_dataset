Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an adversary uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a target system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, leveraging various applications such as Outlook for email delivery, and Excel for executing the malicious payload. The attacker orchestrates the flow from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes persistence on the system.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook
   - **User Action**: The user receives a spearphishing email containing a malicious Excel attachment.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment filename (e.g., `Invoice_2023.xlsx`).
   - **Network Indicators**: The email may originate from a suspicious domain (e.g., `malicious-domain.com`).

   ```shell
   # Monitor for incoming emails with suspicious attachments
   Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Get-MailboxFolderStatistics | Where-Object { $_.FolderType -eq "Inbox" } | Get-MailItem | Where-Object { $_.Attachments -like "*.xlsx" }
   ```

2. **User Interaction with Malicious Attachment**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The user opens the malicious Excel file, which contains embedded macros.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Excel file (e.g., `Invoice_2023.xlsx`), macro code (e.g., `Auto_Open`).
   - **Network Indicators**: Excel may attempt to connect to a command and control (C2) server.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for Excel opening files with macros enabled
   Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq "EXCEL" } | Select-Object -Property Id, Path
   ```

3. **Execution of Malicious Macro**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Excel
   - **User Action**: The macro executes automatically upon opening the file, downloading a payload from the internet.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Temporary files created during the download (e.g., `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe`).
   - **Network Indicators**: Outbound connection to a known malicious IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).

   ```shell
   # Monitor for outbound connections initiated by Excel
   Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object { $_.State -eq "Established" -and $_.OwningProcess -eq (Get-Process -Name "EXCEL").Id }
   ```

4. **Payload Execution**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe)
   - **User Action**: The downloaded payload executes, often using a command like `cmd.exe /c start C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe`.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Execution logs, process creation events.
   - **Network Indicators**: Further connections to C2 servers for data exfiltration or additional payloads.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for command line execution of the payload
   Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4688} | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*payload.exe*" }
   ```

5. **Establishing Persistence**
   - **Application Involved**: schtasks.exe
   - **User Action**: The payload creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence on the system.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task creation command (e.g., `schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp\payload.exe" /sc ONLOGON /ru SYSTEM`).
   - **Network Indicators**: None at this stage, but the task will execute on user logon.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for creation of scheduled tasks
   schtasks /query /fo LIST | Select-String "MaliciousTask"
   ```

6. **Data Exfiltration**
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell
   - **User Action**: The payload may use PowerShell to exfiltrate data to an external server.
   - **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command logs, files being exfiltrated.
   - **Network Indicators**: Outbound connections to external IPs for data transfer.

   ```shell
   # Monitor for PowerShell commands that may indicate data exfiltration
   Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Windows PowerShell'; Id=4104} | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" }
   ```
