1. **Framework Section**  
   **Phase 1: Name Manipulation**  
   - Analyze task and service names for similarities to legitimate processes.  
   - Review descriptions and display names for benign-sounding phrases.  
   - Monitor for the use of non-printing characters or unusual formatting in names.  

   **Phase 2: Service Creation and Modification**  
   - Investigate the creation of new services or tasks that mimic legitimate ones.  
   - Track modifications to existing scheduled tasks or services, especially using commands like `SCHTASKS /Change`.  
   - Examine registry keys related to service creation and persistence mechanisms.  

   **Phase 3: Execution and Persistence**  
   - Observe the execution of tasks or services that have been renamed or disguised.  
   - Monitor for the establishment of persistence through scheduled tasks or services with misleading names.  
   - Analyze command-line arguments and execution paths for anomalies related to disguised services.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**
