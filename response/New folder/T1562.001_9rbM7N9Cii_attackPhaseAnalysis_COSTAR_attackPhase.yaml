1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Disabling Security Mechanisms*  
   - Identify and terminate processes associated with security tools (e.g., antivirus, EDR).  
   - Modify or delete registry keys related to security software functionality (e.g., HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger).  
   - Alter configuration files to disable security features or prevent updates.  

   Phase 2: *Tampering with Security Artifacts*  
   - Unhook or modify DLLs and APIs used by security tools to evade detection (e.g., Antimalware Scan Interface).  
   - Add malicious paths or files to exclusion lists of security tools (e.g., Windows Defender exclusion list).  
   - Use legitimate tools or scripts to manipulate security software behavior (e.g., GMER, PowerTool).  

   Phase 3: *Bypassing Security Controls*  
   - Disable or modify logging features of security tools (e.g., Sysmon logging).  
   - Change system settings to lower security thresholds (e.g., Internet Explorer security settings).  
   - Exploit vulnerabilities in security software to gain elevated privileges or disable protections (e.g., using rootkit removal kits).  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Termination of Security Processes  
     - Examples: "Agent Tesla has the capability to kill any running analysis processes and AV software."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Registry Modification for Security Evasion  
     - Examples: "JPIN can lower security settings by changing Registry keys."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: DLL Unhooking  
     - Examples: "APT38 has unhooked DLLs to disable endpoint detection and response (EDR) or anti-virus (AV) tools."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Exclusion List Manipulation  
     - Examples: "BlackByte Ransomware adds .JS and .EXE extensions to the Microsoft Defender exclusion list."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Disabling Logging Features  
     - Examples: "During HomeLand Justice, threat actors modified and disabled components of endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions including Microsoft Defender Antivirus."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Exploiting Security Software Vulnerabilities  
     - Examples: "Adversaries may abuse tools such as legitimate rootkit removal kits to impair and/or disable these tools."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Altering System Security Settings  
     - Examples: "NanHaiShu can change Internet Explorer settings to reduce warnings about malware activity."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1562.001
