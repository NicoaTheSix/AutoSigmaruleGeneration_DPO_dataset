1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Discovery*  
   - Identify services running on local and remote hosts  
   - Conduct port scans to enumerate open ports  
   - Utilize tools for OS fingerprinting and vulnerability assessment  

   Phase 2: *Exploitation Preparation*  
   - Analyze discovered services for potential vulnerabilities  
   - Map network infrastructure to identify targets for exploitation  
   - Gather information on service configurations and versions  

   Phase 3: *Execution*  
   - Execute exploits against identified vulnerabilities  
   - Establish connections to vulnerable services for further actions  
   - Deploy additional tools or payloads based on reconnaissance findings  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Port Scanning  
     - Examples: "Agrius used the open-source port scanner WinEggDrop to perform detailed scans of hosts of interest in victim networks."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Service Enumeration  
     - Examples: "BlackByte has used tools such as NetScan to enumerate network services in victim environments."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Vulnerability Scanning  
     - Examples: "BackdoorDiplomacy has used SMBTouch, a vulnerability scanner, to determine whether a target is vulnerable to EternalBlue malware."  
     - Associated Phase: Exploitation Preparation  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Network Mapping  
     - Examples: "FIN6 used publicly available tools (including Microsoft's built-in SQL querying tool, osql.exe) to map the internal network and conduct reconnaissance against Active Directory."  
     - Associated Phase: Exploitation Preparation  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Active Directory Queries  
     - Examples: "BlackByte Ransomware identifies remote systems via active directory queries for hostnames prior to launching remote ransomware payloads."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Exploit Execution  
     - Examples: "Ramsay can scan for systems that are vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit."  
     - Associated Phase: Execution  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Custom Tool Utilization  
     - Examples: "APT39 has used CrackMapExec and a custom port scanner known as BLUETORCH for network scanning."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046  

   - **Pattern Name**: Cloud Service Discovery  
     - Examples: "TeamTNT has also used malware that utilizes zmap and zgrab to search for vulnerable services in cloud environments."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1046
