1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Information Gathering*  
   - Utilize OS administration utilities (e.g., `ipconfig`, `ifconfig`, `arp`, `route`) to collect network configuration details.  
   - Execute commands on network devices (e.g., `show ip route`, `show ip interface`) to retrieve interface configurations and routing information.  
   - Leverage specialized tools or scripts to automate the collection of network settings and configurations from compromised hosts.  

   Phase 2: *Data Exfiltration*  
   - Store collected network information (e.g., IP addresses, MAC addresses) in log files or send it to command and control (C2) servers.  
   - Use network protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS) to transmit gathered data back to the attacker.  
   - Monitor for any anomalies in network traffic that may indicate data exfiltration activities.  

   Phase 3: *Follow-on Actions*  
   - Analyze gathered network information to identify potential targets for lateral movement or further exploitation.  
   - Use the collected data to determine access levels within the network and plan subsequent attack vectors.  
   - Implement reconnaissance techniques to map out the network topology based on the information collected.
