1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Discovery*  
   - Identify installed security software and configurations using commands such as `WMIC`, `reg query`, and `tasklist`.  
   - Query system processes and services to detect security tools and their operational status.  
   - Utilize cloud APIs to enumerate security agents in cloud environments (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Azure VM Agent).  

   Phase 2: *Assessment*  
   - Analyze the gathered information to determine the presence of specific security products that may affect adversary operations.  
   - Evaluate system configurations and security settings to identify potential weaknesses or detection capabilities.  
   - Monitor for changes in security software status that may indicate adversary activity or evasion attempts.  

   Phase 3: *Evasion*  
   - Implement checks to avoid detection by security software, such as terminating processes associated with security tools.  
   - Modify behavior based on the presence of specific security products (e.g., exiting if certain AV software is detected).  
   - Use obfuscation techniques to hide malicious activities from security monitoring tools.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Security Software Enumeration  
     - Examples: "Action RAT can identify AV products on an infected host using the command: cmd.exe WMIC /Node:localhost /Namespace:\\root\\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1518.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Process Monitoring  
     - Examples: "DarkGate will not execute its keylogging thread if a process name associated with Trend Micro anti-virus is identified."  
     - Associated Phase: Evasion  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1518.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Cloud Security Discovery  
     - Examples: "Pacucan enumerate AWS security services, including WAF rules and GuardDuty detectors."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1518.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Configuration Checks  
     - Examples: "Mosquito's installer searches the Registry and system to see if specific antivirus tools are installed on the system."  
     - Associated Phase: Assessment  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1518.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Evasion Techniques  
     - Examples: "Epic searches for anti-malware services running on the victimâ€™s machine and terminates itself if it finds them."  
     - Associated Phase: Evasion  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1518.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Registry Queries  
     - Examples: "Carberp has queried the infected system's registry searching for specific registry keys associated with antivirus products."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1518.001  

   - **Pattern Name**: Command-Line Discovery  
     - Examples: "Lumma Stealer has detected antivirus processes using commands such as 'tasklist' and 'findstr'."  
     - Associated Phase: Discovery  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1518.001
