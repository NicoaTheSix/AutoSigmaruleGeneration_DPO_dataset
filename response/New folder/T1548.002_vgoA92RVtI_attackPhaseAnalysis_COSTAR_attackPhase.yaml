1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Privilege Escalation Attempt*  
   - Analyze process creation events for known UAC bypass techniques (e.g., `eventvwr.exe`, `fodhelper.exe`).  
   - Monitor for the execution of processes that typically require elevated privileges without user interaction.  
   - Review command-line arguments for suspicious patterns indicative of UAC bypass (e.g., `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass`).  

   Phase 2: *Execution of Malicious Payload*  
   - Detect the loading of DLLs via `Rundll32` or other methods that may indicate privilege escalation.  
   - Identify the use of COM objects that are auto-elevated and may be leveraged for malicious purposes.  
   - Monitor for registry modifications that could indicate attempts to suppress UAC prompts (e.g., `HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`).  

   Phase 3: *Post-Exploitation Activities*  
   - Track the creation of scheduled tasks or services that may be used to maintain persistence with elevated privileges.  
   - Analyze network connections initiated by processes that have recently bypassed UAC to identify potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.  
   - Review logs for any unusual administrative actions taken by processes that have gained elevated privileges.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: UAC Bypass via Event Viewer  
     - Examples: "BitPaymer can suppress UAC prompts by setting the HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command registry key on Windows 10."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: DLL Hijacking for Privilege Escalation  
     - Examples: "H1N1 bypasses user access control by using a DLL hijacking vulnerability in the Windows Update Standalone Installer (wusa.exe)."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Scheduled Task Abuse  
     - Examples: "CHIMNEYSWEEP can make use of the Windows SilentCleanup scheduled task to execute its payload with elevated privileges."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: COM Interface Exploitation  
     - Examples: "Avaddon bypasses UAC using the CMSTPLUA COM interface."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Registry Manipulation to Suppress UAC  
     - Examples: "LockBit 2.0 can bypass UAC through creating the Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ICM\Calibration."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: PowerShell UAC Bypass  
     - Examples: "Evilnum has used PowerShell to bypass UAC."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Token Impersonation  
     - Examples: "KONNI has bypassed UAC by performing token impersonation as well as an RPC-based method."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002  

   - **Pattern Name**: Use of Legitimate Tools for Malicious Purposes  
     - Examples: "Raspberry Robin will use the legitimate Windows utility fodhelper.exe to run processes at elevated privileges without requiring a User Account Control prompt."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1548.002
