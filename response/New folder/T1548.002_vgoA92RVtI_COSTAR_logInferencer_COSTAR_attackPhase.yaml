1. **Identify Initial Access via Email**  
   - Monitor for the creation of emails with suspicious subject lines, such as "Invoice Attached," particularly from unknown senders. Capture relevant email headers and sender information.

2. **Track Opening of Malicious Attachment**  
   - Detect the opening of Excel files, specifically those named "Invoice.xlsx." Ensure that macros are enabled for these files. This can be identified by monitoring process creation events for Excel with the command line indicating the opening of the specific file.

3. **Monitor Execution of Malicious Macro**  
   - Capture events related to the execution of macros within Excel. Specifically, look for the execution of VBA scripts that include commands like `Shell` or `CreateObject`. This can be done by monitoring for specific process creation events where the parent process is Excel and the command line includes macro execution.

4. **Detect Payload Execution**  
   - Monitor for the execution of newly created executables, particularly those located in the public directory (e.g., "C:\\Users\\Public\\payload.exe"). This should include tracking process creation events initiated by Excel or PowerShell that reference the execution of the payload.

5. **Analyze Post-Exploitation Activities**  
   - Monitor outbound network traffic for connections to suspicious IP addresses or domains, particularly those associated with known command and control (C2) servers. This can be identified by tracking network connection events where the destination address matches known malicious indicators.
