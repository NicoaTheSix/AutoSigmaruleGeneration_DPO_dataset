1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Content Manipulation*  
   - Analyze changes to visual content on internal and external platforms (e.g., websites, intranet).  
   - Monitor for unauthorized modifications to images, videos, or documents that could indicate defacement.  
   - Review logs for access patterns to content management systems (CMS) or file storage systems where visual content is hosted.  

   Phase 2: *Integrity Verification*  
   - Implement checksums or hashes for critical visual content to detect unauthorized changes.  
   - Conduct regular audits of content integrity to identify discrepancies between original and modified content.  
   - Monitor user reports or feedback mechanisms for indications of disturbing or offensive content.  

   Phase 3: *Backup and Recovery*  
   - Ensure regular backups of visual content are performed and stored securely off-system.  
   - Test disaster recovery plans to verify the ability to restore original content after a defacement incident.  
   - Protect backup storage from common adversarial access methods to prevent destruction of recovery assets.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Unauthorized Content Modification  
     - Examples: Modifications to images or videos on a corporate website or intranet.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1491  

   - **Pattern Name**: Integrity Check Failure  
     - Examples: Detection of altered checksums or hashes for visual content.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1491  

   - **Pattern Name**: Backup Compromise  
     - Examples: Failure to restore original content due to backup destruction or alteration.  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1491
