Pattern Name: T1566.001 - Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates a multi-stage spearphishing attack where an attacker sends a malicious email with an attachment that exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Excel. The attack progresses through the initial email communication, the execution of the malicious payload, and the establishment of command and control (C2) communication to exfiltrate data.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

**Stage 1: Initial Email Delivery**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook
- **User Action**: The user receives an email with a subject line "Invoice Attached" and an Excel file named "Invoice_2023.xlsx".
- **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for emails with suspicious attachments or unusual sender addresses.

```shell
# Log email metadata for analysis
Get-MailboxAuditLog -ResultSize Unlimited | Where-Object {$_.Operation -eq "SendOnBehalf" -and $_.Sender -like "*@maliciousdomain.com"}
```

**Stage 2: User Interaction with Malicious Attachment**
- **Applications Involved**: Outlook, Excel
- **User Action**: The user opens the attachment in Excel, triggering macros that download a malicious payload.
- **Key Artifacts**: Excel file with macros, network traffic to a malicious URL.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for Excel files with macros and log any execution of macros.

```shell
# Monitor for macro execution in Excel
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Security-Macros" | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*malicious_macro_name*"}
```

**Stage 3: Payload Execution**
- **Applications Involved**: Excel, PowerShell
- **User Action**: The macro executes a PowerShell command to download a remote payload from a C2 server.
- **Key Artifacts**: PowerShell command, downloaded executable.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for PowerShell commands that download executables from suspicious URLs.

```shell
# Log PowerShell commands that download files
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Windows PowerShell" | Where-Object {$_.Message -like "*Invoke-WebRequest*" -and $_.Message -like "*maliciousurl.com*"}
```

**Stage 4: Establishing Command and Control**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, HTTP/S
- **User Action**: The downloaded payload establishes a connection to the attacker's C2 server using HTTP POST requests.
- **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to C2 server, HTTP headers.
- **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual outbound HTTP/S traffic patterns and connections to known malicious IPs.

```shell
# Monitor outbound HTTP/S traffic for suspicious connections
Get-NetTCPConnection | Where-Object {$_.RemoteAddress -like "*malicious_ip*"}
```

**Stage 5: Data Exfiltration**
- **Applications Involved**: PowerShell, HTTP/S
- **User Action**: The payload exfiltrates sensitive data back to the C2 server using HTTP POST requests.
- **Key Artifacts**: Outbound data transfers, HTTP POST requests with sensitive data.
- **Detection Focus**: Track outbound traffic for large data transfers or unusual file types being sent.

```shell
# Log outbound HTTP POST requests for data exfiltration
Get-WinEvent -LogName "Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing" | Where-Object {$_.EventID -eq 4688 -and $_.CommandLine -like "*curl*"}
```
