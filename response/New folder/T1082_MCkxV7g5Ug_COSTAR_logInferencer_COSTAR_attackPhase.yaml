1. **Identify Initial Access via Spearphishing Email**  
   - **Details**: Monitor for events where a user opens an email with a specific subject line "Important Update" and an attachment named "Invoice_2023.xlsx." This can be tracked through email logs or Outlook event logs.

2. **Map Exploitation of Vulnerability**  
   - **Details**: Detect when the user opens the Excel attachment that contains macros. Look for events indicating the execution of a macro within the Excel application, particularly those that execute PowerShell commands.

3. **Validate Execution of Malicious Payload**  
   - **Details**: Track the execution of the downloaded executable file "payload.exe" located in the %temp% directory. This can be identified by monitoring process creation events where the command line includes "%temp%\\payload.exe".

4. **Monitor for Establishing Persistence**  
   - **Details**: Identify events related to the creation of a scheduled task that runs the payload at startup. Look for events indicating the use of the `schtasks` command with parameters that include "MaliciousTask" and the path to "%temp%\\payload.exe".

5. **Detect Data Exfiltration**  
   - **Details**: Monitor network traffic for outbound connections to the attacker's command and control (C2) server, specifically looking for PowerShell commands that use `Invoke-WebRequest` to send data. This includes tracking any POST requests to URLs like "http://malicious.com/exfil".

6. **Identify Cleanup and Covering Tracks**  
   - **Details**: Look for events indicating the deletion of files, specifically the original Excel file "Invoice_2023.xlsx" and the payload "payload.exe" from the %temp% directory. Additionally, monitor for commands that clear event logs, such as `wevtutil cl Security`.
