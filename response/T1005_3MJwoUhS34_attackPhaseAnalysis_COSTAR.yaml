1. **Framework Section**  
   Phase 1: *Data Discovery*  
   - Identify and enumerate local file systems and directories for files of interest.  
   - Utilize command-line interfaces (CLI) and scripting interpreters (e.g., cmd, PowerShell) to search for sensitive data.  
   - Access and query local databases and configuration files for relevant information.  

   Phase 2: *Data Collection*  
   - Execute automated collection tools to gather files based on predefined criteria (e.g., file extensions).  
   - Use malware capabilities to copy or stage files for exfiltration.  
   - Monitor and log file access and modifications to identify potential data of interest.  

   Phase 3: *Data Exfiltration Preparation*  
   - Prepare collected files for exfiltration by compressing or staging them in specific directories.  
   - Utilize network protocols or command-and-control (C2) channels to facilitate file uploads.  
   - Implement anti-analysis techniques to obscure the collection process and evade detection.  

2. **Behavioral Patterns Section**  
   - **Pattern Name**: Local File Enumeration  
     - Examples: "Fox Kitten has searched local system resources to access sensitive documents."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 1  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Automated Data Collection  
     - Examples: "AuTo Stealer can collect data such as PowerPoint files, Word documents, Excel files, PDF files, text files, database files, and image files from an infected machine."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: File Staging for Exfiltration  
     - Examples: "Forfiles can be used to act on files/directories in a system during (ex: copy files into a staging area before)."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Data Upload via C2  
     - Examples: "Koadic can download files off the target system to send back to the server."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Sensitive Data Retrieval  
     - Examples: "GravityRAT steals files with the following extensions: .docx, .doc, .pptx, .ppt, .xlsx, .xls, .rtf, and .pdf."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 2  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005  

   - **Pattern Name**: Anti-Analysis Techniques  
     - Examples: "Agrius gathered data from database and other critical servers in victim environments, then used wiping mechanisms as an anti-analysis and anti-forensics mechanism."  
     - Associated Phase: Phase 3  
     - Mapping to TTP ID: T1005
