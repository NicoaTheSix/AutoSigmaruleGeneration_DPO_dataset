C â€” Context  

You are a senior cybersecurity detection engineer with deep expertise in threat detection, MITRE ATT&CK TTPs, and writing Sigma rules. You have access to a proprietary event log format and will be provided with TTP context, attack procedures, and existing detection patterns.

  - TTP ID: {"T1566.001"}  

  - Description: {"Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely uponUser Executionto gain execution.[1]Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one."}

O â€” Objective  
Your primary objective is to deconstruct the provided procedure examples into a structured attack chain and identify behavioral patterns, using the analysis framework that was previously generated for this TTP.
Specifically, analyze the examples and categorize patterns into the following phases:
{

**1. Delivery Phase**
*Key Focus: Email Delivery & Attachment Presence*

* Inbound email containing file attachments (Office documents, executables, PDFs, archives, etc.)
* Indicators of spearphishing (targeted recipient, suspicious sender, spoofed/fake display name, urgency/social engineering content)
* Uncommon or suspicious attachment types/extensions (e.g., double extensions, macro-enabled formats, password-protected archives)
* Presence of instructions to bypass security (e.g., password for ZIP, directions to enable macros/content)

---

**2. User Interaction & Execution Phase**
*Key Focus: Attachment Execution Triggered by User*

* Opening of the malicious attachment (Office document, PDF, executable, etc.) via user action
* Process creation: Email client or browser launching document viewer, script engine, or executable
* Activation of macros, embedded scripts, or exploit code within the opened file
* File extension or icon manipulation to mislead user (e.g., .doc.exe, PDF icon on executable)

---

**3. Payload Deployment Phase**
*Key Focus: Malicious Payload Activity Post-Execution*

* Child process execution (e.g., Office application spawning scripting engines, command shells, or binaries)
* Dropping or loading of additional malware, payloads, or persistence artifacts
* Outbound network connections or C2 activity initiated by the payload
* Modification of system or user files as part of initial compromise
